# LGED 23-24 Power Rankings Week 1 - Week 4

## It's Only The Beginning...

### Whaddup

Welcome one and all fellow degenerates.

We are back but this year I decided to change it up. I'm putting out power rankings every few weeks. The previous format was good but decided it was getting a bit stale. 

This will be put out every 4 weeks or so

I know everyone is eager, so lets get to it

Week 4 Third of the way there

## Power Ranking 1
### Tuahot to Handle - Danny
### 4 - 0
|**Power Ranking 1**|
| ------------------------ |
|**Tuahot to Handle - Danny**|
|**4  - 0**      |
One of two undefeated teams left in the league. Danny’s squad has yet to score under 120 points through the first four weeks. It wasn’t all easy though with a .54 victory over Andrew’s team in week 2. Other than Andrew’s team, the three other teams he faced have a combined record of 2 - 10 (Eugene, Kai and Mike). We could point these three teams as a cake walk, but Danny’s team has been putting up big numbers and has the highest points for (63.18 points more than the next). Danny’s team is powered by the 49ers offense, Christian McCaffrey (RB1) and Deebo Samuel (WR15) as well as the lead Dolphin man himself, Tua Tagovailoa (QB6). Big games from the supporting cast have boosted his team to the top. Nico Collins, TJ Hockenson and Travis Etienne Jr. all had a strong week to help Danny’s main cast. It doesn’t even feel like Danny lost J.K. Dobbins. The schedule will get harder for him, but sky's the limit with CMC playing the way he is. 

## Power Ranking 2
### CeeDee-Z Nutz - Matt
### 4 - 0
|**Power Ranking 2**|
| ------------------------ |
|**CeeDee-Z Nutz - Matt**|
|**4  - 0**      |
Our other undefeated team in this early season. The most hilarious thing is, both undefeated teams have played the same teams. <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/51UdTLvbyReqNK3Bic" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/reaction-51UdTLvbyReqNK3Bic">via GIPHY</a></p>

Doesn’t really matter though since Matt is 2nd in Points For. He’s been swimming with the Dolphins. No one else has benefited more from Mike McDaniel’s offense. With Raheem Mostert (RB2) and Tyreek Hill (WR2). AJ Brown(WR8) has  had a nice start to the season. Dak Prescott has been Matt’s one soft spot as he currently has 3 rostered QBs to help with Prescott’s lack of production. At least he didn’t draft Prescott too high… or Joe Burrow for that matter. Isaiah Pacheco(RB12) and Mark Andrews(TE3) seem to be gaining steam. After week 5 though, one undefeated team will remain as Matt plays Danny. The only reason Matt doesn’t get the top power ranking is, unlike his undefeated counterpart, he has the lowest Points Allowed so far.

## Power Ranking 3
### Kingdom DooDoo - Miles
### 3 - 1

|**Power Ranking 3**|
| ------------------------ |
|**Kingdom DooDoo - Miles**|
|**3 - 1**      |
The Kingdom is in good spirits. And why wouldn’t they be? After years of tyranny under shotty drafting, their savior, Auto Draft, has come in and started Kingdom DooDoo on a great start. I kid. Consistency has been the key for Miles this early season. Only once has he dropped below 100 points so far and that was his only loss. Injuries are starting to creep in, but nothing too serious. Davonte Adams(WR6) has been enjoying his new man under center. Tony Pollard(RB8) has never been afraid of stepping up for the Cowboys. Justin Herbert(QB1) has been stellar and looks to be the fantasy QB everyone has wanted him to be for so long. Miles gets bonus points for sticking hard with Auto Draft this year even though it wasn’t really his choice. A lot of prove it guys on his roster and for some reason many Jacksonville WR. He has both Calvin Ridley(WR35) and Christian Kirk(WR27). 

## Power Ranking 4
### Geno’s Kitchen - Andrew
### 2 - 2

|**Power Ranking 4**|
| ------------------------ |
|**Geno’s Kitchen - Andrew**|
|**2 - 2**      |
A bit of a tough schedule for Andrew to start, but his team has played well. Starting off the season, his team played both undefeated teams in back to back weeks. Which included that 0.54 loss to Danny. Since then? Andrew’s team has turned it on with 120+ performances in both week 3 and 4. Waiver wire darling Puka Nacua(WR5) continues to warm Rams fans and fantasy managers’ hearts (no one else cares, he plays on the Rams). Derrick Henry(RB11) just put up his first 20+ point performance. Seems like whenever Henry gets 20+ carries, good things happen in fantasy. Kenneth Walker III(RB5) is one of a handful of RBs that are living up to their draft hype (go hawks). Keenan Allen(WR3) just pushed off Father Time and is playing extremely well. Week 3, Allen had 18 receptions… 9 points allow on 0.5 PPR. Andrew’s team clicking and he’s benching guys DJ Moore(WR13) and CeeDee Lamb(WR16) cause he can.

## Power Ranking 5
### Hurts So Good - Junghwan
### 2 - 2

|**Power Ranking 5**|
| ------------------------ |
|**Hurts So Good - Junghwan**|
|**2 - 2**      |

After his week 1 loss, there had to be questions in Junghwan’s head about drafting Jalen Hurts as high as he did. Hurts(QB5) has been great so far. He hasn’t been as dominant as he was last season but is still putting up solid numbers. Some questions remain for Junghwan at RB behind Brian Robinson Jr.(RB7) and rookie Kyren Williams(RB4) but he has managed so far. There’s help with Jonathan Taylor practicing again with the Colts. The triple threat of Stefon Diggs(WR4), DeVonta Smith(WR14) and Amari Cooper( WR32) has done its job. Diggs continues to produce in fantasy year after year. Honestly I look over him every draft expecting him to be done. With a recent close loss (by .06 points) and Jonathan Taylor coming back soon, I’d say Junghwan earns the number 5 spot.

## Power Ranking 6
### DK’s Left Calf - Zach
### 3 - 1

|**Power Ranking 6**|
| ------------------------ |
|**DK’s Left Calf - Zach**|
|**3 - 1**      |

The beneficiary of a .06 win has Zach sitting pretty at a big 3 - 1. Justin Jefferson(WR1) is doing his thing as the number 1 overall pick in this year’s draft. It honestly seems like he’s just getting started as well. Patrick Mahomes(QB8) and crew are still star struck with Taylor Swift at the games. The Chiefs’ offense looks a little off at the moment. I’m sure they’ll be back to their ways that gets Chris Collinsworth going. Zach has Anthony Richardson(QB12) looking ready to start on the team if Mahomes doesn’t figure it out. Alexander Mattison(RB20) hasn’t been Dalvin Cook of old for the Vikings but has been solid. Alvin Kamara(WR56) is back from suspension and doing Alvin like things in his first week back. I’m jealous of Zach’s D/ST since it’s the Seahawks. Devin Witherspoon looked nice in his prime time debut (go hawks). If Zach’s team continues to win because of the Hawks D, so be it.

## Power Ranking 7
### OJ Forever - Anil
### 2 - 2

|**Power Ranking 7**|
| ------------------------ |
|**OJ Forever - Anil**|
|**2 - 2**      |

Some tough losses through the first four weeks for Anil and OJ. Their team only dipped below 100 points just once in a loss by .16 points. Anil and OJ seem to have good rapport with Dan Campbell as they have both David Montgomery(RB9) and Amon-Ra St.Brown(WR11). Kirk Cousins(QB7) is having one of his best fantasy starts as QB for the Vikings in some time. It’s a good thing too since Joe Burrow(WB31) has been awful and is now on Anil’s bench after drafting him in the 4th round. Travis Kelce (TE6) Despite hurting his knee and missing week one is still doing his thing. And if you haven’t heard… Taylor Swift. The Bills D/ST (D/ST2) has been strong. I have not seen the Bills D be this competitive in a minute. Maybe OJ was brought in to his old team to hype up the D. Things may get a little shaky for Anil when BYE weeks start to roll around or even if a single injury comes up. Not many options on the bench either. Will continue to monitor this and OJ’s twitter

## Power Ranking 8
### MotherTuckers - Connor
### 1 - 3

|**Power Ranking 8**|
| --------------------- |
|**MotherTuckers - Connor**|
|**1 - 3**  |

Mother Tuckers is probably what Connor says week to week seeing his team’s output. Connor has yet to break over 100 points. He almost did week one which is his only win of the season so far. He’s not been able to catch any teams on a bad week yet. Connor’s team sits at third for Points Allowed. All of his woes are definitely caused by number 2 overall pick, Austin Eckler(RB38). Eckler has been out since week 1 with no clarity on when he’ll be back. The rest of Connor’s RBs will need to step up if he wants over 100 points week to week. They aren’t necessarily bad. They are getting the carries they need, it’s a mix of their respective teams not doing too well offensively… or just overall. DK Metcalf(WR22) has been steady but needs those big games that we have seen here and there in the past. Mike Evans(WR10) is showing great value after falling to the 6th round in the draft. A couple of big performances and Connor will be able to nab some wins. All about not falling too far behind before Eckler returns.

## Power Ranking 9
### Yoon Pooned - Mike
### 1 - 3

|**Power Ranking 9**|
| --------------------- |
|**Yoon Pooned - Mike**|
|**1 - 3**  |

A walk in the park win week 1 thanks to playing the lowest scoring team, since then? A bit of a struggle. One loss by 0.49 with another loss to the highest scoring team after being the second highest scoring. I’m nitpicking for sure. My goal was to stay afloat until Cooper Kupp returns from the IR. 1 - 3 is really just the second worst scenario. A stroke of luck with Nick Chubb going down and Jerome Ford(RB15) playing well in his place. Rookie Bijan Robinson(RB7) has been great so far. Still waiting for Bijan to have his big performance game, I know it’s coming. Josh Allen(QB3) is heating up. Definitely trying to swing for the fences with the WRs that I am playing. Brandon Aiyuk(WR13) and Michael Thomas(WR46) are only in for boom or bust. But really… HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS D/ST??? Besides week 3, one of my highest performing players. Kupp looks to return in week 5, hopefully good things to come.

## Power Ranking 10
### Going for the Hat Trick - Eugene
### 1 - 3

|**Power Ranking 10**|
| --------------------- |
|**Going for the Hat Trick - Eugene**|
|**1 - 3**  |

Number 1 in Points Allowed in this early season. It’s not the only reason for all of Eugene’s troubles, but it doesn’t help. It’s really the only reason why he’s not in the bottom 2 in the power rankings. He has only broken 100 points once which is his only win so far. The last two weeks? He’s averaging in the mid 70s, both for losses. Saquon Barkely(RB27) going out obviously was not good. But at least there seems to be a chance Barkely returns soon. Aaron Jones(RB34) after a great week 1 performance has been out as well. After those two, the fantasy talent drops off a bit. Darren Waller(TE14) hasn’t been what Eugene or the Giants have hoped for. Josh Jacobs(RB17) has been solid and just had his best game of the season in week 4 with 23.9 points. But can Jacobs carry the team? WRs will be a constant struggle for Eugene’s team. All steady outputs, but is it enough? There are clear QB issues as well. Eugene will have to remain active in the waiver wire or trade. If he doesn’t , he has to put a lot of faith in his team with players either on the downward trend of their career, can’t stay healthy or haven't proven themselves yet. As for if he completes the hat trick, there are still plenty of teams in the power rankings that will be in the running.

## Power Ranking 11
### Dumpster Fire - Kyle
### Record: 1 - 3

|**Power Ranking 11**|
| --------------------- |
|**Dumpster Fire - Kyle**|
|**1 - 3**  |

Kyle has had very similar output to the other bottom third of the power rankings. The difference being the Points Allowed for Kyle has been low and have all been winnable games. Winnable here is the opponent having under 110 points. His point differential in those losses is 19.72 on average. Kyle hasn’t benefited as much from the Dolphins offense as others have with Jaylen Waddle(WR58) being in and out. It’s been a rough start for 3rd overall pick Ja’Marr Chase(WR29). No one is feeling the Joe Burrow slump more than Kyle and Chase. The faith was so low in Burrow that Kyle actually benched Chase in week 3, which was Chase’s best performance so far. I don’t blame him, but a big call for sure. Kyle also has Joe Mixon(RB20). Once Kyle’s top draft picks start to play what we all expect them to, he’ll start to string some wins together. Depth may be the issue for Kyle. One injury, for most fantasy teams, might bury Kyle’s team. It’s too early to start thinking like that I guess, but something to watch as the season continues.

## Power Ranking 12
### Poop AUTO - Kai
### 0 - 4

|**Power Ranking 12**|
| --------------------- |
|**Poop AUTO - Kai**|
|**0 - 4**  |

Tough, unlucky, tragic. The only winless team in the league. Injuries have plagued Kai early. Nick Chubb and Mike Williams both with season ending injuries. Aaron Rogers out after 4 snaps hurt Kai’s second round draft pick Garrett Wilson(WR17) value early. Things have not been awful though for Wilson. Despite all this, Kai has put up solid numbers. Removing week 1’s disaster, he’s near the Points For total as other teams in the bottom half of the league. Lamar Jackson(QB4) has been good so far. Not to his MVP form, but one of the better fantasy starts since that season. Not sure if Kai’s team has the boom potential that is needed in fantasy. Steady week to week scoring will get you a few wins here and there, but as we all know, it’s the big scoring weeks that ensure you a playoff spot. In past seasons, we’ve seen Kai lose the first 4 games but still manage to make the playoffs. This year seems different with the injuries, but don’t count out Poop AUTO.



#### Good luck you fucking degenerates
