# LGED 21-22 Week-1 Recap: Let Season 4 of LGED Begin

### Whaddup
Welcome back Degenerates. The 21-22 season has finally begun. We have stadiums at full capacity, 17 regular season games and, as always, someone getting roasted every week.

This is a Public Service Announcement:
If you haven’t given me your buy-in yet, do so ASAP. You know who you are.

An exciting week 1 is in the books. We had 2 games that went down to the wire during Monday Night Football. Outside of that, we saw winning teams this week win by an average of 37.87 points. Hopefully this is not foreshadowing the rest of the season.

Let’s get into it.

|     **DK’s Left Calf**      |**134.86**     | OJ is my GM|   92.94   |

All I can say for Zach’s team is Go Hawks. He may not have DK Metcalf this year but he’s got the rest of the flock. Zach and the Seahawks offense hand Anil a week 1 loss. Russell Wilson, Chris Carson and Tyler Lockett combined gave Zach 62.26 points. Fun fact about Zach’s team: He only has 1 AFC player, Tyler Boyd, on his entire team. He’s repping the NFC hard. Ohh it goes even further, his starting lineup this week consisted of only NFC East and West players. Zach only has 2 players on his entire team that aren’t in those divisions. DeAndre Hopkins doing Nuke things with 83 yards and 2 touchdowns with just 6 catches. A strong week 1 for Zach after a not so great season last year. Anil let OJ draft a lot of his team this year. You may have seen OJ in the draft room as “Auto Draft”. OJ did well to put the team together. Brandon Aiyuk was high on pre-draft rankings but was not targeted in a high scoring showing from the 49ers. Allen Robinson II couldn’t really get anything going and had just 35 yards. Austin Ekeler did end up suiting up and found the endzone in an otherwise quiet performance. Keenan Allen doing Keenan Allen things with 9 catches on 13 targets for 100 yards. The shining star this week for Anil was T.J. Hockenson who had the most amazing transformation from this season to last:

Hockenson went off for 21.7 points. OJ drafted a solid team for Anil. It’s early but Anil and OJ will need to work together to bolster the squad.

|     **EBDB BnB**      |**147.46**     |  Smokin’ Herbs |   114.48  |

He didn’t skip a beat. EBEBEBEB EEBEBEB (Andrew’s team) is your highest scoring team this week. Tied for last season’s highest scoring champion showed up in week 1. More on Andrew’s high flying performance below. It’s always tough to have a solid week and end up playing the highest scoring team of the week. Matt’s team really didn’t do anything wrong. A lot of his players who crushed it last season might just be warming up? Justin Herbert didn’t lock into his Offensive rookie of the year form and put up just 13.38 points. Dalvin Cook wasn’t cookin like was last year but did manage to find the endzone and record 104 yards from scrimmage. George Kittle had an alright performance but you hope he scores a touchdown to put the cherry on top of his 78 yard game. All the announcers during Monday Night Football could talk about was Josh Jacobs’ turf toe. It may have slowed Jacobs’ yardage but he managed to score 2 touchdowns. Corey Davis looking good in Jets green with 24.2 points. If this is a somewhat down week for Matt’s team, look out.

|     **Kingdom DooDoo**      |**110.3**     |  I need Moore points |   70.18  |

Kingdom DooDoo has one its first battle of the season. Miles slays Junghwan’s team by 40.2 points. Darren Waller picks up where he left off last season with 10 catches on 19 targets (yeah 19 targets wow) for 105 yards and a touchdown. Not sure if the Lions’ know to run the ball with RBs or just use them as WRs. D’Andre Swift had almost as many catches, 8, as rushes, 11. Miles’ isn’t complaining as Swift puts up 20.4 points. Miles also has Lions’ RB Jamaal Williams who put up a similar stat line with 9 carries and 8 receptions for 21 points. Williams was on the bench though. There is a king in Kingdom DooDoo now, Derrick Henry. This year’s draft’s number one overall pick didn’t do much with just 58 rushing yards. King Henry didn’t need to do much however, as Junghwan’s team just fell flat. I say this every time Junghwan loses, but he really did need Moore points. Junghwan had only 2 players score over 10 points, Brandon Cooks and Ryan Tannehill. Speaking of the Titans, they just got spanked by the Cardinals. Julio Jones may have been spanked the most with just 3 catches for 29 yards. The rookie Kyle Pitts didn’t get much going but was targeted 8 times. Junghwan’s RBs provided nothing for a combined 8.6 points. Although, the good news from his RBs was that Saquon Barkley did play. He was on the field for 48% of the Giants’ snaps. Hopefully Barkely will go back to his pre-injury days. Junghwan will need it as he was the second lowest scoring team this week.

|     **Carroll’s A Coward**      |**97.68**     |  Fudge Packers |   61.22  |

Behind Patrick Mahomes, Kyle’s team gets the easy win against this week’s lowest scoring team of the week, Connor and the Fudge Packers. More on Connor’s stanky performance below. Kyle was the third lowest scoring team this week, but it didn’t matter. Maholmes put up 33.28 points which accounts for more than a third of Kyle’s points this week. Kareem Hunt scored both a touchdown and a 2-point conversion for a great week for being a “backup”. James Robinson took a surprising backseat to Carlos Hyde. Robinson rushed well though with 5.0 yards a carry. If the ball wasn’t going Christian McCaffrey’s way, it wound up in DJ Moore’s hands. Moore made the most of his targets with 80 yards and even rushed for 14 for 12.4 points. Rob Gronkowski’s performance in the first game of the season was wasted on the bench. Kyle’s bench went off. He has 2 QBs on his bench. You remove one of them and his bench still scored 80.2 points. I’m surprised Davante Adams was able to salvage 8.1 points in a pretty bad showing from the Packers. In fact, both these teams suffered because of the Packers. Kyle’s team looks ripe for more points in week 2 and onward.

|     **Poop AUTO**      | **138.16**   | Yoon Pooned |   132.2   |

Lamar Lamar Lamar. The man hurt my team in more ways than one on Monday Night Football. The reigning champion of the LGED wins week 1 against my team, Yoon Pooned. Kai had the second most points this week behind a stellar performance by Kyler Murray. Murray had 5 total touchdowns with 289 passing yards, 20 rushing yards and 1 interception. Murray finished with 33.56 points. Joe Mixon and Travis Kelce both had 22+ points. Miles Sanders was all over the field with 109 yards from scrimmage and 2 point conversion for 15.3 yards. Steelers D/ST blocked a punt for a touchdown which propelled the Kai’s defense to 13 points. But to seal the deal, it was Marquise Brown. Going into Monday Night Football, Kai held on to a 7.56 point lead. Kai had Brown to play and my team had Lamar Jackson. It seemed like I had it in the bag… but when the lights shined bright, Jackson seemed frazzled while Hollywood Brown embraced the limelight. It didn’t help that the only touchdown Jackson had was a TD pass to Brown. Brown finished with 16.4 points, Jackson with 18. It was brutal to watch Lamar fumble the ball twice. Of course it doesn’t just come down to one game. The Buccaneers D/ST helped me out with -3 points. Nick Chubb also fumbled but still had a great game with 83 rushing yards, 18 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns. Tyreek Hill was the second highest scoring WR this week with 31.6 points. It was fun watching the Browns vs Chiefs’ game. This match up had 2 of the top 5 scoring teams this week. My team is hoping for ball security week 2.

|     **2 Girls 1 Kupp**      | **110.2**     |  Catch 22 |  109.92   |

Monday Night Football claimed another victim week 1. Danny saw a 1% ESPN Fantasy Football probability win rate come to fruition. Danny snags the victory from Eugene’s team. What a comeback. Eugene had a 11.72 point lead going into Monday Night Football. The Baltimore D/ST choked (-1 points) while Danny’s kicker Daniel Carlson (11 points) came through in the clutch. Danny pretty much maximized his team’s points this week. Danny only missed out on about 1 point on his bench. Jalen Hurts had a great start to the season with 264 passing yards, 62 rushing and 3 touchdowns. Alvin Kamara had a good outing with 16.6 points in that Saints beatdown of the Packers. Calvin Ridley like the rest of the Atlanta offense did get much going. Chris Godwin was Danny’s best receiver with 19 points. Danny is still probably looking for a running back to help Kamara out. Slow, painful loss for Eugene. That OT touchdown, loved the play call from Jon Gruden, sealed the deal in the most hilarious way possible. Christian McCaffrey did his usual game with 98 rushing yards and 89 receiving yards. CMC was the highest scoring RB this week. Dak Prescott looked good in his return from injury with 27.42 points. Eugene not only lost this game but Raheem Mostert for the rest of the season due to knee cartilage damage. Eugene’s WRs and TE all scored 10+ points. A tough loss, but so entertaining for the rest of us… especially Danny.

## Highest Scoring Team
**EBDB BnB**\
**147.46 Points**\
**Best Player: Amari Cooper WR - 32.4 Points**\
Starting off the highest scoring team with 147.46 points isn’t bad\
Despite Tom Brady throwing 2 interceptions, he still managed to throw for 4 touchdowns and 379 yards\
David Montgomery was really the only good thing happening for the Bears on Sunday Night football\
Amari Cooper goes off as the highest scoring WR this week with 32.4\
Noah Fant returns to EBDB BnB with a solid outing with 6 catches for 62 yards\
Fant was one of 2 players on Andrew’s team to not score 10+points\
The Seahawks fan in me hopes DK Metcalf is just warming up… fantasy side of me hopes he doesn’t\
Andrew was also last season’s week 1 highest scoring champion\
I’m hoping this season, he wins it only once\

</br>
</br>

## Lowest Scoring Team
**Fudge Packers**\
**61.22 Points**\
**Best Player: Adam Thielen WR - 25.7 Points**\
Holy… 61.22 points in week 1 is rough\
Thank god Adam Thielen had the week he did. Excluding him, you scored 35.52 points\
Stefon Diggs had a decent game but the only thing we really liked was that he hit the number 69  in receiving yards\
Aaron Rogers was in true MVP form with 1.32 points… he had less fantasy points than interceptions(2)\
Your RBs combined had 11 rushing yards\
Oh lets add in the RBs you had on the bench... 13 rushing yards total\
You know what, for this week, we’ll let you add the bench points into your final week 1 scoreline… you are now the 2nd lowest scoring team\
At least there is help on the way… oh wait\
Michael Thomas is out for 4 more weeks\
Zack Moss was a “healthy scratch” I don’t see him suiting up week 2\
Wouldn’t be a bad idea to tear it down and make some drastic trades\
However, you remind us to take a deep breath and to not hit the panic button week 1. It’s a long season.\
So for that, we thank you.



#### Good luck in week 2 you fucking degenerates
