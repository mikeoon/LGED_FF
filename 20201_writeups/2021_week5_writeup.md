# LGED 21-22 Week-5 Recap: A Power House Division Emerges?

### Whaddup

A High scoring week for the LGED. The divisions are starting to take shape. One is looking a little top heavy. The top 3 teams in that division combine for 13 wins… dare I say Power House? While the other division is looking scrappy. Still, as I have said in every writeup so far, it’s early. Time flies and you will reminisce of the early season days.

We also saw a new record for highest scoring team. And a familiar face gets roasted.

Let's dig in. Enjoy

|     **Yoon Pooned**      |**140.48**     | Im just… Tired|   66.98  |

Eugene and his team still haven't gotten their beauty rest and remains winless. Eugene for the second time this season is the lowest scoring team. More on Eugene’s sleepy performance below. My team takes advantage of Eugene’s injury riddled squad. Yoon Pooned has now won 4 straight. It looked like an okay week until Lamar Jackson roared back against the Colts on Monday Night Football. Lamar finished the game with 442 passing yards, 4 passing touchdowns and 62 rushing yards. Cordarrelle Patterson finally gets the starting nod for my team and puts up 114 yards from scrimmage. Nick Chubb rushes for a season high 161 yards. Tyreek Hill managed to put together a 10+ fantasy point game in a poor showing by the Chiefs. My team is humming. I’m praying that the squad isn’t peaking too early.

Matt’s team comes up big in week 5 and is the highest scoring team this week. Him and his team have also set the record for highest scoring week so far. More on Matt’s big week below. Back to back losses for Danny as he now sits 3 - 2. In both losses, Danny’s opponent scored 135+ points. Strange week for his team. His main starters (QB, RB, WR) all scored 10+ points with 2 of them scoring 20+. However, the lesser scoring starting slots (TE, FLEX, K, D/ST) only combined for 8.5. Kenny Golladay did get hurt. I guess Golladay couldn’t handle being the face of the Inn. Jalen Hurts continues to impress. He’s my main talking point when I write on Danny’s team for a reason. Hurts now sits at the number 6 QB in fantasy and has never dipped below 20 points. That’s some amazing value in the 11th round of the draft.

|     **EBDB BnB**      |**136.44**     | Poop AUTO|   119.26   |

I call this the Battle of 500. Back to back wins for EBDB BnB. Andrew is now above .500 and drops Kai below .500. For BnB, Tom Brady bounced back with his best game of the season after having his worst game in week 4. Brady throws for 5 touchdowns for the second time already. He hurt his thumb.. But do GOATs even have thumbs? Jonathan Taylor also put up his best game of the season so far with only 53 rushing yards but 116 receiving yards. Taylor also scored a rushing and receiving touchdown. AND you guessed it, another player on Andrew’s team had his best fantasy game of the season. DK Metcalf puts up 98 yards and 2 touchdowns. In Geno Smith we trust, go hawks. Next up, OJ is my GM. Kai has lost a bit of steam after starting 2 - 0. The steam that powered those two wins have just cooled off.

|Player| Avg week 1 and 2 | Avg Week 3 - 5|
|:------:|:------------------------:|:--------------------:|
|Kyler Murray| 33.33|18.2|
|Travis Kelce| 21.5|10.97|

It’s really only these two players and I’m definitely picking on them. Kai’s RBs have been… in the words of Eugene, tired. Melvin Gordon only really makes an impact if he scores a touchdown. Miles Sanders can’t break over 8 points. Ronald Jones II is an after thought in the Tampa Bay offense. Joe Mixon has been solid, but not an RB1. It’s not all bad though. Mike Evans is having a great start to fantasy this year and right now is WR 11. Marquise Brown is loving Lamar Jackson’s arm and is WR 6. Poop AUTO isn’t hitting the panic button just yet.

|     **Carroll’s A Coward**      |**113.18**     | DK’s Left Calf|  106.58  |

The winning streak continues. Kyle’s team is now 5 - 0. His latest victim, Zach. Both of these team’s star QBs had a bit of dip in their fantasy production. One more explainable than the other. Patrick Mahomes continues to throw interceptions. He’s had one every week except for in week 1. Normally, Mahomes shoots himself out of trouble and throws more touchdowns than picks. This is the first time he hasn’t ( 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions) and it has shown up in fantasy as his work week so far. Despite the Jaguars being 0 - 5, James Robinson has just put up his third 20+ game in a row. Kareem Hunt has scored a touchdown every week except for week 2. Davante Adams has his biggest game of the year with 11 catches for 206 yards and a touchdown. The Browns D/ST even gave Kyle -6.0 points. Next up, the Golladay Inn Express. Zach’s team didn’t start out that hot on Thursday Night Football. Russell Wilson going down with mallet finger was tragic. TRAGIC. Go hawks, in Geno Smith we trust. Alex Collins and Tyler Lockett both put up 8.2 points each. Darrell Henderson Jr. was running easy on TNF for 82 yards and a touchdown. Ezekiel Elliot also has a 3 week streak of 20+ points in fantasy. DeAndre Hopkins actually had a season high of 9 targets. And what do ya know, Hopkins also had a season high in receiving yards with 87. The real story for Zach is how his Seahawks players will do without Russ. Only time will tell.

|     **Kingdom DooDoo**      |**146.4**     | Fudge Packers|   137.46  |

I really thought Connor was going to come back on Monday Night Football again. Miles gets his fourth win of the season against Connor behind 3 of his players scoring over 30 points. Josh Allen goes [Air Jordan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN81CT8EYkA) as he hurtles over a Kansas City defender < and also scores 4 total touchdowns. Derrick Henry continues to sit at the throne for Kingdom DooDoo with 130 yards and 3 touchdowns. King Henry is showing us why Miles drafted him number 1 overall. Mike Williams has been ballin. When Williams records 100+ yards, he has also scores 2 touchdowns. He had a whopping 16 targets in week 5. D’Andrew Swift has produced well so far. Swift continues to be the do it all back in Detroit. It was my boy Younghoe Koo’s first time hitting over 10 points as a kicker this season. Miles and King Henry are running the Kingdom well. Next up, a battle of 4 - 1 teams against Yoon Pooned. Connor with another tough loss. The Fudge Packers this week were the 4th highest scoring team. Of course, this week, the team plays the 2nd highest scoring team. Connor has 4 Bills players on his team. Surprisingly, Connor started the wrong 2 Bills. Zack Moss and Stefon Diggs Combined for 18.6 fantasy points. While on the bench, Dawson Knox and Emmanuel Sanders combined for 38.1. Connor definitely played the right TE and Mark Andrews did his best to claw back on MNF with 11 catches for 147 yards and 2 touchdowns. Andrews’ 36.2 points is triple his previous highest scoring game. Aaron Jones has been a little quiet since his week 2 performance. His fellow Aaron, Aaron Rogers, has just been alright. However, Robert Woods put up 150 yards on 12 catches and Michael Thomas could be returning soon. Hopefully the tough losses are behind the Fudge Packers.

|     **OJ is my GM**      |**91.7**     | I need Moore points |   88.12  |

The closest matchup this week. Anil and his team get their first win of the season against Junghwan. This was a gritty matchup. Both teams were pretty much powered by 2 players each. Anil’s team was behind Austin Ekeler and Antonio Gibson. Ekeler had 119 yards from scrimmage with 2 rushing touchdowns. One of which looked like the Browns were escorting him into the endzone. Gibson also scored 2 touchdowns and managed 60 rushing yards. Outside of those two… not much. The rest of Anil’s team combined for 41.1 points. Next highest scoring player for OJ is my GM, Kirk Cousins with 13.4. Cousins had been solid through 3 weeks averaging 24.14 points. Cousins the last 2 weeks? 11.8. Regardless, Anil gets the win and brighter days may be ahead. Junghwan’s team got gutted. Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkely both left Sunday’s game with injuries. They left the game with a combined 5.72 fantasy points. Najee Harris and Kyle Pitts were the two players to shine for Junghwan. Both Rookies. Harris has been nice so far and it was actually his second time to score exactly 21.2 points (he did the same in week 3). Pitts has his first 100+ yard receiving game in the NFL and also his first regular season touchdown. The rest of Junghwan’s team combined, 44.6 points. His team has been hit hard with injuries. He now has 4 players total on his roster that are injured. Julio Jones and Sterling Shepard on the bench. Junghwan will catch a break soon… soon?

## Highest Scoring Team
**Smokin’ Herbs**\
**158.82 Points**\
**Best Player: Justin Herbert QB - 42.82 Points**\
Damn, maybe I was wrong to call out the ESPN pundits for raving about Justin Herbert\
Herbert threw for 4 touchdowns for the second time this season, he also rushed for 1 this week for a total of 5\
Rookie Ja’Marr Chase has been great\
Ja’Marr already has 5 touchdowns total so far… must be that LSU chemistry\
No Dalvin Cook? No problem. Alexander Mattison put up his 2nd 20+ point game with Cook out\
There was even more to be left on the bench for Matt\
Antonio Brown 7 catches for 124 yards and 2 touchdowns\
Myles Gaskin (go dawgs) 99 yards from scrimmage and 2 receiving touchdowns\
I’m pretty sure ESPN Fantasy “Gurus” were saying to drop Gaskin\
Matt, you made the LGED proud that you didn’t listen to them

<br>

## Lowest Scoring Team
**Im Just ... Tired**\
**66.98 Points**\
**Best Player: Dak Prescott QB - 20.68 Points**\
You’re back\
Dak Prescott aside, your team scored 46.3 points\
The highest scoring team this week scored 3.4 times that\
Only 2 players reached at least 10 points\
Your QB and your kicker\
You’ve got Josh Gordon on the bench, at this point I’m beginning to think you’re doing other extracurricular activities outside of managing your lineup\
Again, outside of Prescott, no one scored a touchdown\
No one even broke over 60 yards\
From scrimmage, your team had just 229 yards combine\
Your team combined for 14 receptions… that’s just 2 more than Robert Woods had alone\
Your RBs combine for just 30 rushing yards\
However, you remind us how quickly injuries can set in and gut a team\
So for that, we thank you.

#### Good luck in week 6 you fucking degenerates
