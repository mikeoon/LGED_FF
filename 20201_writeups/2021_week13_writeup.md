# LGED 21-22 Week-13 Recap: One Hot Playoff Spot Left

### Whaddup

The second to last week of the LGED regular season is upon us. Unfortunately, not much drama for playoff spots heading into the final week. In week 13, we saw teams in the drivers seats for playoff spots all win leaving just 1 team with a chance to crack the top 6 teams.

The first two tiebreakers for playoff seeding goes to head to head (H2H) record then points for.

We also saw my team‚Äôs amazing streak end. I know all of you were just as heartbroken as I was.

Let‚Äôs get into week 13.

|     **Leonard‚Äôs Bakery**      |**146.54**     | DK‚Äôs Left Calf|   91.54  |

Danny and Leonard‚Äôs Bakery knock Zach and DK‚Äôs Left Calf out of contention for a playoff spot with a pretty big week. All but 2 players on Danny‚Äôs team scored over 10 points. Leading the charge, Justin Jefferson. Jefferson hauled in 11 catches with 182 yards and a touchdown. He now sits at WR3. Javonte Williams is heating up at the right time for the Broncos and Danny‚Äôs team. Williams puts up his second 100 yard rushing game of the season while also adding 76 receiving yards and a reception touchdown. Joining the 100 yard club, Chris Godwin with 143 receiving yards on a whopping 15 catches. Jalen Hurts was out due to an ankle sprain so in comes Taylor Heinicke who did just enough with 14.84 points. The Bakery is flexing its muscles going into the playoffs showing off why they are top of the West division. Tough loss for Zach as his season will end after week 14. Starting the season Zach was touting out starting lineups of only NFC players primarily from the West and East divisions. My how things have changed with Marvin Jones Jr. and Dolphins D/ST having made the lineup breaking up the NFC comradery. Dallas Goedert didn‚Äôt want Zach's team's run to end, putting up his best game of the season with 105 yards and 2 touchdowns. Dolphins D/ST continues to roll allowing only 9 points with 3 sacks and 1 interception. Tyler Lockett finally scored a touchdown, his first since week 2. DeAndre Hopkins returns but it‚Äôs little too late with 2 catches for 32 yards and a touchdown. Zach will look to end the season on a high note against Eugene.

|     **Smokin‚Äô Herbs üö¨**      |**149.88**     | Kingdom DooDoo|   60.0  |

A  ‚ÄúI belong in the playoffs‚Äù win by Matt‚Äôs team. Miles unfortunately gets knocked out of playoff contention and also is this week‚Äôs lowest scoring team. More on Miles‚Äô DooDoo performance below. Matt‚Äôs team puts up the second highest points this week which is also his own second highest week this season. All the waiting for George Kittle seems to be paying off at the right time. Since week 9, Kittle has dipped below 10 points just once. He has scored 5 touchdowns in 5 weeks. This week, Kittle caught 9 passes for 181 yards and 2 touchdowns. Diante Johnson recorded his second 105 yard game of the season but this time found the endzone twice. Johnson‚Äôs highest scoring week this season, 26.5 points. Justin Herbert now has 3 straight 300+ passing yard games. Herbert seems to be finding his early-mid season form this week. Josh Jacobs adds to all the scoring with a touchdown of his own, his second in 2 weeks. All of this scoring output with Dalvin Cook on the bench. Matt must be feeling good as he sits in the 4th seed of the playoffs through 13 weeks. If and when Cook returns, look out (I said this last week but for real though).

|     **OJ is my GM**      |**102.1**     | Poop AUTO  |   93.3  |

The Streak-Playoff Hope Killer: Anil and OJ. Anil didn‚Äôt end Kai‚Äôs playoff hopes but it does make things pretty interesting heading into week 14. Even with a kicker on bye, Anil cruises for the win. With playoff hopes gone for a while, Anil and OJ are just out here to make trouble. Keenan Allen put up his highest scoring week with 19.9 points behind 34 yards and 2 touchdowns. Austin Ekeler also found the endzone and rushed for 59 yards. The LA Chargers have been scoring well behind Allen and Ekeler. Antonio Gibson nearly breaks 20 points again this week but falls just 0.4 points short. T.J. Hockenson put up back-to-back weeks with a touchdown, his second time this season. Hockenson last put up two weeks with a touchdown back in week 1 and 2. Kirk Cousins has really limited his turnovers this season. Cousins overall has only 5 turnovers through 13 weeks. Cousins still sits in the top 10 for QBs in fantasy. Talking with Kai in week 12, he foresaw this L coming. A slight down week for Kai and Poop AUTO. 4 straight weeks with over 100 points until now. Matthew Stafford is starting to limit his turnovers and has now put up back to back 20+ point fantasy performances. Mike Evans didn‚Äôt find the endzone but did put up with 99 receiving yards on 7 catches. Michael Gallup has been solid the last 2 weeks putting up 13.1 and 12.1 fantasy points. For a guy who has been injured since week 1 and returned week 10, he‚Äôs found midseason form. Joe Mixon cooled off like much of his fellow Bengals‚Äô players. Mixon after rushing for 120+ yards for two weeks straight, he put up just 54 but did rush for a touchdown. Kyler Murray is back. Marquise Brown and Travis Kelce both had a quiet week as they combined for just 12.2 points. Playoffs are very much a possibility for Kai, winning next week would secure it.

|     **EbDB BnB**      |**154.42**     | Fudge Packers|   72.5  |

Andrew makes his return for the highest scoring crown this week defeating Connor and the Fudge Packers. More on Andrew‚Äôs return to greatness below. Tough loss for Connor as he now does not fully control his fate in making the playoffs. Connor is the only team remaining to even crack a playoff spot. He‚Äôll need a win next week and one of three teams to lose. Then, he‚Äôll need to hope he has a better H2H record against them. Doable, all very doable. This week though it was just a down week. Adam Thielen just recorded 1 catch for 0 yards. Thanks to the wind on Monday Night Football, Dawson Knox was only able to bring in 2 catches for 14 yards for his second worst fantasy performance of the season with 2.4 points. His fellow WR Stefon Diggs also couldn‚Äôt do much thanks to the wind and recorded his worst game of the season. It wasn‚Äôt all bad. Elija Mitchell found the endzone on top of 66 rushing yards. And Joe Burrow despite 3 turnovers managed to put up 16.6 points as he was the QB streaming option since both Aarons on Connor‚Äôs team were on bye. Connor is still in it and fighting. He‚Äôll be hoping his streak of going .500 continues in the final week against Kai. Kai‚Äôs team is one of the three Connor needs to lose for a shot at a playoff spot. Spicy.

|     **Carroll‚Äôs A Coward**      |**82.16**     | Im just ‚Ä¶ Tired|   67.32  |

Even with some crucial byes, Kyle‚Äôs team does enough to snag a win from Eugene. The wait for Rob Gronkowski‚Äôs return has been worth it. Since his return, Gronk has not dipped below 10 fantasy points. This week, Gronk found the endzone twice. Miles Sanders has his best game of the season behind a season high in carries and rushing yards (24 and 120). Hunter Renfrow may have finally found a home in LGED. Renfrow has been on 3 different teams. Renfrow currently has a 2 game streak of 100+ receiving yards. He has been good this season as he sits at WR22. James Robinson was benched after a fumble and only managed 24 yards. A good win to help solidify a playoff spot for Kyle. He looks to clinch a spot next week against EBDB BnB. Another day in the office for Eugene. His team is a bit in shambles as once again he cannot fill his RB slots with active players. Despite the Cowboys putting up 27 points, Dak Prescott didn‚Äôt capitalize. Prescott threw for 238 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Van Jefferson has been nice as he found the endzone for the second week in a row. Eugene also has Odell Beckham Jr. who also scored a touchdown for the second week in a row. Only 2 players on Eugene‚Äôs starting roster scored over 10 points. Christian McCaffrey was shut down for the rest of the season. Clyde Edwards-Helaire returned 2 weeks ago and maybe hasn‚Äôt found his form just yet. Eugene‚Äôs season is pretty much a wrap at this point as next week is just a coluslation game against DK‚Äôs Left Calf.

|     **I need Moore points**      |**102.26**     | Yoon Pooned|   100.62  |

The streak is over. Junghwan ends my team‚Äôs 11 game streak thanks to the strong winds in Buffalo on Monday night.The Bills behind Tyler Bass goes for a field goal in the 4th quarter, only to miss and give my team -1 point and seal my fate. Solid week for Junghwan as he grabs his 5th win of the season. Unfortunately, he is out of playoff contention. A solid outing this week. Only three of Junghwan‚Äôs starting roster didn‚Äôt score 10+ points. The star this week was Alexander Mattison thanks to his fellow RB mate Dalvin Cook sitting out. Mattison rushed for 90 yards and a touchdown. Najee Harris continues to be one of the best rookies this season with 71 rushing yards and 36 receiving yards. Harris has only dipped below 10 points just twice this season. I may have jinxed Derek Carr last week as his 20 point streak ends with 12.36. Saquon Barkley hasn‚Äôt really gotten going after his return from the ankle injury. However, this was his best game so far with 10.4 points. A lot of what ifs for Junghwan as the main one being Barkley‚Äôs health. Kyle Pitts showed flashes his rookie season but wasn‚Äôt able to put together some consistency. A chance for Junghwan to stir the pot a bit next week as he plays Smokin‚Äô Herbs üö¨ who‚Äôs looking to lock in a playoff spot. Tough to end the streak that way. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I definitely wanted to win out. This probably means I lose my first matchup in the playoffs. My team is in a bit of a rut still. Last two weeks my team was putting up points in the 80s. This week, Yoon Pooned just got over the 100 point mark. Tyreek Hill had his worst game of the season with 2 catches for 22 yards. Hunter Henry isn‚Äôt finding the endzone as of late and it has severy impacted his fantasy output. It‚Äôs not all bad. James Conner continues to find the endzone as he records another one for 14 total on the season. The Cordarrelle Patterson renaissance season continues as he puts up 96 yards from scrimmage. Patterson has only dipped below 10 points twice while missing only one game to injury. And of course, Cooper Kupp doing Cooper Kupp things. My team seems to be picking it up a bit after 2 low scoring weeks. Next up, a consultation game against OJ is my GM.

<br>
<br>

## Highest Scoring Team
**EBDB BnB - Andrew**\
**154.42 Points**\
**Best Player: Tom Brady QB - 28.62 Points**\
Oh yay Tom Brady is back\
Brady puts up his sixth 4+ touchdown game this season\
Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase who?? All about Tee Higgins who puts up 138 yards and a touchdown\
Jonathan Taylor and David Montgomery combine for 284 yards from scrimmage and 3 touchdowns\
Taylor leads the league in rushing touchdowns and just continues to be a monster\
Jaylen Waddle has been nice this season. Waddle has been targeted heavily all season and is efficient\
Waddle has scored 10+ points 8 times this season and sits at WR14\
EBDBBBDBEBDB BnB is looking nice going into the final week of the fantasy regular season\

<br>
<br>

## Lowest Scoring Team
**Kingdom DooDoo - Miles**\
**60.0 Points**\
**Best Player: Mike Williams WR - 13.5 Points**\
Damn at least you scored 60 points on the dot\
In total, your team scored 2 touchdowns\
One was from Adrian Peterson who‚Äôs age is more than half your team‚Äôs points\
In fact, if we used Peterson‚Äôs age as fantasy points, he would have out scored more than half your team combined\ 
Your bench had a third of your starting squads points which seems like little but only 1 person on your bench even played\
More than a third of your entire roster is injured or just didn‚Äôt play\
Taking away your top 2 players, your team scored 34.8 points\
Overall just not a good performance\
However, you always remind us how quickly a fantasy season can turn after an injury to just one player\
So for that, we thank you.


#### Good luck in week 14 you fucking degenerates
