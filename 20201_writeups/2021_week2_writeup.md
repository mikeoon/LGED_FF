# Week-2 Recap: MNF Keeps Handing Out L’s

### Whaddup
Week 2 is in the books and Monday Night Football hates and loves some of you in the league. We saw 2 more teams get handed an L thanks to MNF. Not only that, but MNF also crowned the lowest scoring team.

By the way, Kyler Murray is wizard. Look at this throw and catch:

The scoring was up from last week and the winning margins were a bit lower. Things are getting real entertaining.

On to the writeup

|     **2 Girls 1 Kupp**      |**109.9**     | EBDB BnB |   104.34   |

After winning the highest scoring title last week, Andrew and the BnB fall to Danny’s team. I am writing this on Sunday night and Danny has the W without even playing a TE; a hard flex. Danny’s team put up solid numbers this week. Besides his RBs, everyone on his team put up 11+ points. Despite the Eagles only scoring 11 points against the 49ers, Jalen Hurts somehow managed to put up 21.8 fantasy points. Hurts had just 190 passing yards but did put up 82 rushing yards and a rush TD. If this is Hurts’ slow week, we could see him finish in the top 10 for QBs this year. Kicker Daniel Carlson makes 4 field goals and 2 extra points for 17 points. All of Danny’s starting WRs had very similar games:

| Player  | Yards | Receptions   | Targets   |
| ------------------------ |:-------------:| --------------------|:----------:|
|   Calvin Ridley      |  63   | 7 |  10  |
|   Justin Jefferson  |  65   | 6 |  10  |
|   Chris Godwin     |   62  | 4 |  5  |

On the other hand, Andrew’s WRs didn’t have as good of a week. DK Metcalf and Amari Cooper combined for just 77 yards. Tee Higgins however did put up another touchdown this week while also seeing an uptick in targets (5 last week to 10 this week). Andrew leaned a bit on Tom Brady who threw for 5 touchdowns which was one more than last week. Brady is putting up some juicy numbers early and says that the Buccaneers have more to show. MVP Brady season incoming??? Maybe, Brady did also have a fumble though. Tony Pollard, on Andrew’s bench, did outscore his backfield mate Ezekiel Elliot. Andrew could have used the points as his starting RBs combined had only 15.2 points. Andrew is now .500 while Danny picks up his second win in a row.

|     **Yoon Pooned**      |**135.76**     | Smokin’ Herbs |   102.2   |

Both teams in this match were looking for their first win. My team not only snags the win, but also the highest scoring team of the week. More on my team’s performance below. For Matt, 2nd round pick Josh Jacobs sat out with what I am guessing is that turf toe they kept commenting about last week. Myles Gaskin (Go Dawgs) tried his best to be the next man up but only managed 6.6 points. The Dolphins did get shut out by the Bills and were trying to catch up all game. Dalvin Cook did break over 100 yards though. It took him the 2nd game to do it. George Kittle did manage to catch all 4 of his targets but only for 17 yards. Corey Davis suffered a bit in fantasy production behind Zach Wilson’s awful day. Davis had just 2 catches for 8 yards. Diontae Johnson and Ja’Marr Chase have been good so far. Both putting up 12+ points in the first 2 games of the season. Despite Matt’s higher draft picks sitting out or under performing, he’s finding value in his mid round picks which is a good sign.

|     **Poop AUTO**      |**131.11**     | Catch 22 |   72.88   |

Kai and Poop AUTO continue their good start to the season with another great outing. Eugene on the other hand is the lowest scoring team of the week. More on Eugene’s poor showing below. Kai’s team started the week strong with kicker Graham Gano kicking 5 field goals (two 50+ yarders) and 2 extra points. Gano was tied for 2nd highest scoring player on Kai’s team this week. Kyler Murray continues to dominate and is the number one fantasy QB through 2 weeks. Mike Evans finds the endzone twice this week after last week’s mediocre performance. Travis Kelce putting up fantasy first round pick numbers with back to back 20+ point weeks. A little bit of concern at the RB position for Kai. Kai’s three RBs combined for only 21.9 points. Kai was just 1 starting roster change away from highest scoring. Kai starts his campaign for back to back LGED championships 2 - 0.

|     **Kingdom DooDoo**      |**135.16**     | DK’s Left Calf |   132.42   |

One of two losses dished out on Monday Night Football. Miles nabs the W during the last minutes in the fourth quarter thanks to D’Andre Swift. Swift had 9.8 points which was more than enough to give Zach and his calves’ the loss Miles was just 0.6 points away from tying the highest scoring team. Kingdom DooDoo’s king, Derrick Henry put the team on his back after falling flat last week. Henry just trampled the Seahawks in the second half. King Henry put up a whopping 44.7 points with 182 rushing yards, 3 rushing touchdowns and 55 receiving yards. Henry also recorded a career high in receptions with 6 (previous record was just 4). Mike Williams got the starting nod from Miles and put up 91 yards and a touchdown. This is Williams’ second week in a row with 10+ targets. Zach had a 7.06 point lead going into Monday Night Football. Not sure how confident Zach was, but it’s the Lions, you never know. Zach had a great week. His faith in the Seahawks offense is rewarded again. Tyler Lockett continues to slip by safeties. Lockett scored higher than he did last week behind 8 catches for 178 yards and a touchdown. Ezekiel Elliot did pick it up this week, but was outscored by “Backup” Tony Pollard by 6.5 fantasy points. Zach’s brother, Andrew (EBDB BnB),  has Pollard, I’m sure that’s a lot of fun. Actually all of Zach’s RBs scored a TD this week. However, Darrell Henderson Jr. did get a little banged up. The Rams’ and Zach are hopeful he will suit up next week. Zach’s team was the third highest scoring team this week. It’s just bad luck to be playing the second highest scoring team.

|     **Fudge Packers**      |**124.2**     | I need Moore points |   108.28   |

The Fudge is sweet this week. Connor roars back to win on Monday Night Football behind Aaron Jones and Aaron Rogers. MNF’s other L handed out this week goes to Junghwan. Connor was down 49.38 points going into the final game of the week. It seemed bleak. Especially after the Packers’ performance last week. Connor more than doubled his points behind 2 players. Aaron and Aaaron, combined for 65.3 points. It’s almost as if the Aarons knew Connor needed them to combine forces. Rogers threw 3 touchdown passes on the night ALL to Jones. Jones put the cherry on top with a rushing TD of his own to put up 4 total. It’s the night fantasy football players dream of. The rest of Connors’ team did just alright. Not much to talk about if 2 guys on the team outscore the rest. After getting the lowest score last week, the Fudge Packers got carried this week. And they ain’t complaining. On the flipside, mannnnn. Junghwan must have thought he had it in the bag. Junghwan didn’t have an amazing week, but it seemed like what his team put together was enough to get the win.Terry McLaurin started things off well with 107 yards and a touchdown on Thursday Night Football. Saquon Barkley didn’t go off but did better than last week. Brandin Cooks having a little bit of a career revival these last two weeks with back to back 15+ point games. Rookie Najee Harris almost tripled his points from last week behind his first regular season touchdown in the NFL. Don’t fret Junghwan, it’s early and Saquon is just warming up.

|     **Carroll’s A Coward**      |**110.22**     | OJ is my GM |   90.78   |

Kyle’s team last week gets the win over the lowest scoring team. This week, the second lowest. Not to take anything away from Kyle’s team. Powered by Patrick Mahomes’ back to back 330+ passing yard games. Mahomes didn’t put up a rushing touchdown and seemed to be out of his element in Baltimore. On the other hand, Rob Gronkowski continues his touchdown run. Gronk has now put up back to back 2 touchdown weeks to start the season. Kyle’s first round fantasy pick, Davante Adams bounces back with 8 catches for 121 yards which is twice as many yards as he had last week. Kyle’s RBs are somewhat of a concern but he is getting wins regardless. Anil’s team doesn’t hit 100 points again this week. His team seems to be just in a rut to start the season. Kicker Josh Lambo didn’t help with -1 points. Joe Burrow didn’t have a good game. And DJ Chark Jr. just had 1 catch last week’s great game. It’s not all bad though. Allen Robinson found the endzone. Anil’s Chargers’ players are enjoying the active offense with Austin Eckler and Keenan Allen putting up 115 yards from scrimmage and 108 receiving yards respectively. T.J. Hockenson played well catching 8 passes and finding the endzone again. A touchdown or two here, a better performance there, and Anil’s team will be in the win column in no time.

## Highest Scoring Team
**Yoon Pooned**\
**135.76 Points**\
**Best Player: Lamar Jackon QB - 32.26 Points**\
Lamar Jackson, I never lost faith\
Jackson still had 2 turnovers but still managed to put up 32.26 points\
Cooper Kupp is loving Matt Staford in LA\
Kupp has now put together back to back 100+ yard games to start the season\
Nick Chubb continues to score touchdowns\
The Buccaneers D/ST also wanted to get in on the touchdown action thanks to Mike Edwards’ 2 pick sixes\
Who would have thought Mike Davis(9.8) would outscore Tyreek Hill(4.4)\
I hope to make some money back this year\
Out of 3 seasons, I am definitely in the negative column\

<br>

## Lowest Scoring Team
**Catch 22**\
**72.88 Points**\
**Best Player: Christian McCaffery RB - 22.2 Points**\
Last week MNF hands you the L\
This week, MNF hands you the lowest scoring team title\
Your first round draft pick and second pick overall Christian McCaffery barely outscored your opponents kicker (by just 0.2 points)\
Your starting roster had as many turnovers as touchdowns this week at 2 a piece\
AJ Brown caught just 3 of his 9 targets against the Seahawks D/ST you started\
The Seahawks D/ST put up -2 points\
This week was just so pedestrian for your team\
So not worth roasting, there just isn’t anything even to poke fun at\
If I were you, I would just tell people that you have been cursed by Monday Night Football\
Otherwise people might just wonder how you drafted such a mediocre team\
Your team hasn’t one a game yet\
However, you remind us that a slow start early in the season doesn’t mean it’s over (usually)\
So for that, we thank you.
