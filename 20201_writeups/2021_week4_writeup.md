# LGED 21-22 Week-4 Recap: Front, Middle and Back of the Pack

### Whaddup

We are back after an unplanned break thanks to the Mariners. Heart breaking, but also so familiar. A couple of us went to the game on Saturday. You could call it our playoff moment.

This week in the LGED gave some clarity on who's who in the league. We have 1 undefeated team with 2 winless teams. The front runners and the teams carrying the rear seem to be revealing themselves... Probably not though. It’s fantasy football and still very early. Especially with 1 extra regular season game this year.


Enough talk, let's dive in.

|     **I need Moore points**      |**124.58**     | DK’s Left Calf |   85.56   |

Let’s goooooooo! Junghwan gets his first win of the season against Zach. Good win with Junghwan’s team putting up his season high so far in fantasy points. Junghwan harnessed the power of the NFC East. Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkely put up good numbers. Barkley’s best game of the season while it’s Jones’ second best game. Terry McLaurin put up 123 yards and 2 touchdowns. McLaurin has to be on the list of underrated WRs in the league. Chuba Hubbard, probably my favorite player in Fantasy football now. What a name. With CMC out, Hubbard stepped up and did a decent job with 71 yards from scrimmage. Fellow rookie Najee Harris put up another 20+ point game, his second of the season. Even with the Rams D/ST getting torched by the Cardinals and putting up -5 fantasy points, Junghwan cruised to his first W. Zach and the Seahawks got off to a slow start Sunday against the 49ers. Zach’s team really felt it. Tyler Lockett and Chris Carson combined for just 55 yards of offense. Despite their low production, Russell Wilson was still able to put up 3 total touchdowns for 22.56 points. Ezekiel Elliot puts up his second 20+ point game in a row. Elliot seems to have found his groove after some week 1 worries. Dallas Goedert has been great for Zach’s team after being drafted in the 11th round. Solid TE. A down week for Zach in this early season. First time his team has dipped below 100 points. His all NFC squad just needed a little breather.

|     **Smokin’ Herbs**      |**W_points**     | Poop AUTO |   91.62   |

Matt’s team nabs the win over Kai on Monday Night Football thanks to Justin Herbert. Both Matt and Kai’s team now sit at 2 - 2. Herbert looks great so far, but the pundits at ESPN need to slow their role with the MVP talk and generational talent. Herbert put up 21.28 points. Matt got very, very little from his RBs this week. Dalvin Cook and Myles Gaskin combined only rushed for 37 yards and neither recorded a touchdown. Diontae Johnson sat out last week but picked up where he left off in week 2 and put up 92 yards and a touchdown. Johnson has been good despite the Steelers woes. George Kittle hasn’t been the stud that he once was. Pretty obvious the QB woes in San Francisco aren’t helping him. The Bills D/ST caught 4 interceptions, recovered a fumble and was able to get 3 sacks. They were Matt’s second highest scoring starter. Some more production from Matt’s RBs and he’ll be on a roll. A baby slide for Kai and Poop AUTO. Kai drops his second game in a row. After starting the season with back to back 130+ point weeks, Kai’s team has now put up back to back under 100 point weeks. Just like Kittle, Travis Kelce didn’t do much this week with just 4 catches for 23 yards. Kyler Murray continues to cool off after his hot start to the season. Miles Sanders didn’t see much despite the Eagles putting up 30 points. Marquise Brown has been solid so far and is Kai’s second highest scorer this week behind Murray. Some points left on the bench that may have won it for Kai. Tough roster decisions ahead for Poop AUTO, I sense a WR carousell.

|     **Carroll’s A Coward **      |**137.72**     | Kingdom DooDoo |   101.92   |

Kyle for the second week in a row is the highest scoring team. He must have been upset I missed last week’s writeup and made sure this week he would get his praise. More on Kyle’s encore below. The clash of the 2 undefeated teams. Miles and the Kingdom get handed their first loss this season. We all thought Derrick Henry was going to be pillaging the Jets due to Julio Jones and AJ Brown sitting out. King Henry ended up with 33 carries for 157 yards and a touchdown. Chase Edmonds has had a great start to the season. Edmonds has put up 10+ fantasy points with no touchdowns. Darren Waller the last three weeks has had 7 targets each game. That is a significant dip from week 1’s 19 targets. Mike Williams was the number two fantasy receiver til this week and only put up 1.6 fantasy points. Seems to be a bit of an average week for the Kingdom. Miles has scored over 100 points every week so far.

|     **EBDB BnB**      |**122.86**     | Im just … Tired |   71.82   |

Bouncing back from last week’s loss, Andrew’s team gets the win over Eugene who’s just… tired? Andrew’s team is now .500 thanks to a great week from everybody. Almost all of Andrew’s players scored 10+ points. Jaylen Waddle being the only player to not. In fact, everyone but Waddle and Tom Brady scored a touchdown. Brady must have chocked up in New England and just let off the gas. Brady coming into the week was the number 1 QB. In week 4, he scored a little more than a third of his average. Both of Andrew’s RBs rushed for over 100 yards. A great win after back to back losses. Here comes the EBDB. Eugene remains winless through 4 weeks. It’s been tough and we can see why he’s so tired. Christian McCaffrey going down in week 3 was brutal, but he will be back. Joining McCaffrey not playing for Eugene this week include A.J. Brown, Chase Claypool and Logan Thomas. There are some bright spots and players trying to hold down the fort. The NFL is a next man up league… so I guess so is fantasy football. Clyde Edwards-Helaire has put together back to back weeks with touchdowns. Dak Prescott is looking revved up with another 27 point performance. Henry Rugs III finally gets the starting nod from Eugene, but falls flat with just 3 catches for 60 yards. The injury bug has plagued Eugene early. Rest up, plenty of time left to come back.

|     **Fudge Packers**      |**96.62**     | OJ is my GM |   67.72   |

Connor has changed his recipe and the fudge is solid now. Connor and the Fudge Packers hand Anil and OJ their 4th straight loss. Anil is also the lowest scoring team of the week. More on his performance below. The Fudge Packers favor playing 2 guys from the same team. Aaron Rogers and Aaron Jones combine for 33.52. Zack Moss and Stefon Diggs combined for 27 points. Who says you can’t succeed with 2 guys from the same team? They just don’t mention you have to do it twice. Robert Woods is showing signs of life with 48 yards and a touchdown. Adam Thielen has his worst game so far with 3 catches for 46 yards. Even though ESPN projected points are bullshit, they did project Mark Andrews’ points perfectly with 9.2 fantasy points. The wins keep rolling in for Connor and the Fudge Packers. Next up is Kingdom DooDoo

|     **Yoon Pooned**      |**136.34**     | Golladay Inn Express |   93.28   |

3rd win in a row for Yoon Pooned. Danny and the hotel motel Golladay Inn get handed their first loss of the season. Tyreke Hill just carried this week for my team. The last two weeks he only had a combined 8 catches for 71 yards. This week, Hill goes off for 11 catches for 86 yards and 3 touchdowns. This has propelled Hill to the number 2 WR in fantasy football. Nick Chubb recorded 100 rushing yards. Mike Davis didn’t have much but did get a receiving touchdown. Cooper Kupp did better than last week and still holds the crown as the number 1 ranked WR in fantasy. My team is looking good so far, hope this hot streak lasts all the way til week 17. Danny has a new gig as the Golladay Inn Express manager and this was the Inn’s first 1 star rating since he’s been hired. Danny’s team only had 1 touchdown that wasn’t from a QB. Thank you Justin Jefferson. Jalen Hurts does continue to be a solid fantasy QB despite his team just getting handed Ls. Alvin Kamara has been pretty underwhelming so far as the 4th overall pick. Where’s all of Kamara’s production in the passing game??? His NFC South buddy Calvin Ridley has been solid with just one game under 10 points (week 1). My only gripe is, Kenny Golladay on the bench? Name the Inn after him and straight to the bench. Golladay had a good game with 6 catches for 116 yards. Maybe the Golladay Inn Express has some vacant rooms now after that 1 star review.

## Highest Scoring Team
**Carroll’s A Coward**\
**137.72 Points**\
**Best Player: Patrick Mahomes QB - 31.72 Points**\
Okay okay, we see you\
Kyle’s team is undefeated through 4 weeks and has won back to back highest scoring titles\
Patrick Mahomes with 5 passing touchdowns\
James Robinson putting up back to back 20+ point games\
Fun fact, when Robinson puts up 20+ points, Kyle is the highest scoring team (sample size 2 games lol)\
DJ Moore has been loving Sam Darnold under center\
Moore now has 3 straight games of 8 catches, this week Moore puts up 27.9\
Kareem Hunt continues to score touchdowns for Cleveland\
I haven’t even mentioned Davante Adams yet who’s had a good season so far despite the week 1 woes\
The last team to start the season 4 and 0 went on to win the league… I hope I didn’t jinx it

<br>
<br>

## Lowest Scoring Team
**OJ is my GM**\
**67.72 Points**\
**Best Player: Austin Ekeler RB - 28.0 Points**\
Speaking of undefeated, your team is winless\
You’ve put together a great 0 and 4 start\
Your team has only broken 100 points just once\
If it wasn’t for Austin Ekeler on MNF, your team would just have 39.72 points\
Your only receiving touchdown came from Ekeler an RB\
Your TE, FLEX, K, and D/ST slot combined for 0.2 points\
You’ve been talking up Mac Jones where’s the love???\
Jones outscored your starting QB Kirk Cousins by 6.87 points which would have saved you from this roast\
I guess DJ Chark did fracture his ankle on Thursday Night Football\
Your bench WRs, two total, combined for just 3.1 points\
Might need to start paying OJ some more money to get him to GM the team a bit better\
However, you remind us to stay active on the waivers incase of injuries\
So for that, we thank you.

<br>

#### Good luck in week 5 you fucking degenerates
