# LGED 2020 Week-3 Recap: All the Action on Monday Night Football

### whaddup
Monday Night Football was not only a huge matchup for two great AFC teams, but a lot hung in the balance for us degenerates. A few matchups were decided, 
4 teams total were in the running for highest scoring team, and a lowest scoring team was decided. In the league, 3 teams remain undefeated while 2 teams are... defeated.

Major shoutout to my guy Jermain Kearse for retiring this week. Seahawks put up a dope tribute video of him on their [twitter account](https://twitter.com/Seahawks/status/1311000575631261696?s=20)

Let’s get into week 3.


**Poop AUTO (134.04)** vs DK’s Left Calf (77.1)\
Zach and DK’s Left Calf are this week’s lowest scoring team. The lack of big time fantasy play woes continue, but this time Zach finds himself at the bottom. More on the pedestrian week below. Poop AUTO keeps on rolling with another great performance. Josh Allen continues to do work in the air and on the ground with back to back 30+ point performances. Allen is only a few points behind Russell Wilson for that number 1 QB spot. Marquez Valdes-Scantling was non-existent but the Packers’ kicker Mason Crosby with a 16 point performance to make up for Valdes-Scantling’s shortcoming. Alvin Kamara just ballin for the Saints, surprised they are 1 - 2 but hey, at least Kai is reaping the rewards. Devante Adams was out this week, if he weren’t, Kai could have been $10 richer. Poop AUTO is shitting on teams. Next week is a tasty matchup against Eugene, Catch 22.


**OJ is my GM (114.4)** vs Yoon Pooned (110.58)\
Anil and OJ get their first win against my squad on Monday Night Football. Clyde Edwards-Helaire needed 12.08 points to win it, just cruised to get 15.9. I am hella jealous that Anil has Russell Wilson on his team. To watch the hawks get W’s behind Russell Wilson’s 14 TD’s and scoring big time for your fantasy team? Dreams really do come true, #NoTime2Sleep. For reference, last year’s MVP and leader in passing TD’s, Lamar Jackson, ended the season with 36. Allen Robinson II loved the benching of Mitch Trubisky and found the end zone thanks to Nick Foles to cap off Robinson’s best game of the season. Antonio Gibson is finding some success in Washington’s running game as the goal line back. Anil looks to keep the momentum in week 4. My team has lost all momentum. My first week recording over 100 points. The brightside? Derrick Henry and Keenan Allen found some of their groove with 281 yards from scrimmage and 3 TD’s combined (49.7 points). Got a little more out of my QB slot this week behind Ben Roethlisberger. Diontae Johnson, also on the Steelers, gets knocked and leaves the game under concussion protocol. Devin Singleary stepped up after his RB mate in Buffalo Zach Moss was ruled out. I really went all in on the Titans this week playing 3 in my starting lineup. They combined for 36.6, meh. Chris Carson comes away with a sprained knee after a bullshit tackle by the Cowboy’s Trysten Hill. Fuck you man. Hope Carson and George Kittle come back soon, or else my losing streak will continue.


**Carroll’s A Coward (107.68)** vs Kingdom DooDoo (93.6)\
Kyle is also among the undefeated. I was hoping this matchup would be decided on MNF with Patrick Mahomes on Kingdom DooDoo and Lamar Jackson on Carroll’s A Coward. It was surprisingly close. Jackson wasn’t the hero for Kyle’s squad, it was the Colts D/ST. The Jets blow and the Colts just trampled them. They finished with 27 points, the highest by a D/ST so far this season and also Kyle’s best player this week. Calvin Ridley continues to put on a show in Atlanta. Ridley gave Falcon’s fans what the team would look like when Julio Jones retires, a winless season. Amari Cooper’s last three weeks are as follows:


| Amari Cooper Fantasy points |           |
| --------------------------- |:---------:|
| Week 1                      | 13.1      |
| Week 2                      | 13.0      |
| Week 3                      | 13.1      |


What a stud.

Major props for playing Laviska Shenault Jr. best damn name in the league. Lamar Jackson had 2019 Divisional Round Playoff vibes with a shell of a performance. Was really in Mahome’s shadow. [Speaking of Pat](https://twitter.com/tootgail/status/1310751505901850624?s=20), I want to thank Miles for drafting him in the first round. Mahomes scored 40.0 fantasy points this week, just a little under half Miles’ total. Imagine if someone else had drafted him, they would be running away with the league. Sorry Miles, I really won’t let it down you drafted him round 1, expect a joke about it every week. The Tampa Bay duo that did so well last this time, Mike Evans and Leonard Fournette combined for 16.4 points. Just 4.4 points higher than UW running back God Miles Gaskin. Darren Waller was a no show after an awesome performance last week. Let’s see how far Mahomes can take Miles.


**Catch 22 (136.5)** vs 2 Girls 1 Kupp (122.6)\
Despite losing Christian McCaffrey last week, Eugene is your highest scoring team of the week. Clinched the title on Monday Night Football in a 3 way race for the top spot. More on Eugene and his squad’s performance below. Danny put up a good fight against Eugene and crew. Loved seeing Danny snag Mike Davis off the waivers just as he played Eugene to rub the McCaffrey injury in his face, some good history there too. Gardner Minshew II with the surprisingly horrible game on Thursday Night Football against the Dolphins. Minshew threw the ball 42 times completing 30 of them for only 71.4 yards. He fumbled and threw an interception. Not his night. A.J. Green is a true shell of himself these days, 18.1 points in 3 weeks. However Dalvin Cook is putting up good numbers and picking up where he left off last season. Michael Gallup and Sony Michel finding their rhythm as well combining for 37.8. A tough loss for Danny as he remains winless, next up is The Shady Bunch who also find themselves winless.


**EBDB BnB (133.18)** vs The Shady Bunch (129.78)\
EBDB BnB continues to roll in his 2020 fantasy football campaign, while the Shady Bunch remains winless. A tough one for Connor and the bunch. Andrew’s squad was one of the 4 teams that were contending for the highest scoring team. Harrison Butker missed a Field Goal and an extra point which may have led to Andrew's hat trick of the crown of highest scoring team. Everyone played well for EBDB, Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot continue to be a powerful one two punch in fantasy football (42.8 points combined). Robert woods and DeAndre Hopkins put up similar numbers, 18.9 and 18.7 respectively. That Buccaneers D/ST is piecing it together after a poor showing in week 1. At least Andrew’s BnB didn’t get highest scoring this week, he could be slowing down. Damn, I really thought Connor had it this week. Especially when watching the hawks game. Tyler Lockett caught 3 TD’s and had exactly 100 yards receiving. Nick Chubb didn’t miss a beat from his last performance with 23.5 points. Aaron Jones came back to earth a bit but still managed to find the endzone.Where he needed something wasn’t the two Dolphin’s players he played, Mike Gesicki and DeVante Parker (17.4 combine), it was the Bills D/ST. After going up 21 - 3 against the Rams, the Bills allowed the Rams to score 29 points in the 2nd half. Erasing 2 interceptions and a fumble recovery for 0.0 fantasy points to end the game. Connor and his team have done well. In his first 3 matchups of the season, he has lost by 4.02, 3.52, and 3.4. Next up is Danny’s team, both winless but someone has to walk away a winner… right?


**Post Mahomes (135.52)** vs I need Moore points (113.48)\
Injuries??? That doesn’t bother Post Mahomes. Matt is dialed right now with his lineups, playing the right guys in every slot. To be fair he has to cause 3 of his players on his bench are injured… a blessing in disguise. Aaron Rodgers and the Packers are quietly having a great start to the season. Austin Ekeler is out there doing his best Christian McCaffrey impression with 11 catches for 84 yards, 12 carries for 59 yard and a TD. Was James Connor injured week 1? He has put up 19.1 and 22.9 in the last 2 weeks. James Robinson had a great game in an otherwise bad loss against the Dolphins on Thursday Night Football. Matt was in the running for highest scoring team with the Ravens D/ST to play. The Raven’s just looked hella slow out there against the Kansas City WR and managed just 1.0 point. Junghwan finds himself under .500 but a decent performance. Junghwan had a chance for the win and highest scoring team if he had played Rex Burkhead (31.3 points) instead of John Brown (0.0 points) at his flex. Hindsight is 20/20. Cooper Kupp had his best game of the season with 9 receptions for 107 yards and a TD. Junghwan benches Drew Brees for Joe Burrow, wasn’t all that bad of a decision. Mark Andrews is in a fantasy rut with back to back disappointing performances (3.4 and 3.7). Josh Jacobs has gone a little bit down hill since week 1. It’s still early though and Junghwan, unlike Matt, has to figure out his lineups a bit. Stay active on those waiver wires kids.


## Highest Scoring Team
**Catch 22 - Eugene**\
**136.5 points**\
**Best Player: Kyler Murray QB - 22.0 points**\
Dang, lose CMC and no big deal\
Only one player on Eugene’s team scored less than 13.0 points\
DK Metcalf should have ended with more than 17.0 but had a DeSean Jackson-esque moment right before he scored\
It seems like Eugene’s got all the NFC West nominations for Offensive Player of the Week:\
Kyler Murray (Ari), Darrell Henderson (LAR), Jeff Wilson Jr. (SF), and Metcalf (Sea) combine for 77.6 points which out scores the lowest scoring team by 0.5\
Chris Godwin came away injured (hamstring) but still managed to give Eugene 14.9\
He may have named his team after CMC, but he is winning fantasy games and cash without him

## Lowest Scoring Team
**DK’s Left Calf - Zach**\
**77.1 points**\
**Best Player: Matthew Stafford QB - 18.5**\
Zach, your team is the only one that hasn’t broken 100+ points yet\
Only one player on your team broke over a 100 yards from scrimmage, Miles Sanders\
Maybe you found luck in the endzone?\
Only one player found the endzone, JuJu Smith-Schuster\
The JuJu Smith-Schuster and Marvin Jones combined were targeted 8 times\
Your starting rosters’ combined yards from scrimmage was 338 which is only 5 more yards than your opponent’s (Poop AUTO) total receiving yards\
I’m actually struggling to find anything to really roast in this abysmal performance from your players this week\
Just flat out… flat\
However, you remind us that fantasy football is all about managing ebbs and flows\
So for that, we thank you.


#### Good Luck in Week 3 you fucking degenerates.
