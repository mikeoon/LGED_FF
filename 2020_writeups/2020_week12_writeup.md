# LGED 2020 Week-12 Recap: The Regular Season Dust Begins to Settle

### Whaddup

I hope everyone had a good Thanksgiving break and are already gearing up for the December holidays. Week 12 brought about the longest week in NFL history. Week 12 started on the morning of 11/26 and ended during the day on 12/2, thanks COVID.

With the final week of the fantasy regular season next week, week 12 always brings closely watched matchups and constant refreshes of the ESPN Fantasy app.

 A few notes on week 13:
Games will begin on Sunday, 12/6
There are two games on Monday 12/7
The last game is on Tuesday 12/8

**Remember** Tie breaker for the standings and playoffs is points for.

Here is week 12

|     **Yoon Pooned**      |**132.04**     | DK’s Left Calf |   59.42   |

My team gets the much needed win to keep in the playoff hunt. Zach’s team may have checked out at this point but we’re all happy he’s still active. Zach’s team is unfortunately the lowest scoring team this week. More on this performance below. The week for my team started out with a bang thanks to Will Fuller V on Thanksgiving morning. Fuller had his best game of the season with 32.1 points. It was also his last game as Fuller is now suspended for 6 games for PEDs. Thanks Will, it was fun while it lasted. Derrick Henry runs all over the number one defense in the NFL. Henry ran for 178 yards and rushed for 3 touchdowns. Chris Carson finally returns and finds the endzone. Also finding the endzone was Keenan Allen. Allen also extends his touchdown streak to five weeks. Up next for Yoon Pooned is EBDB BnB in a must win matchup to secure a playoff spot.

|     **Catch 22**      |**111.3**     |  Kingdom Doodoo |   99.08   |

Eugene and the current NFL leading scorer Younghoe Koo win this matchup against the King of Doodoo, Miles. Eugene’s highest scorer this week was Koo with 21 points. Koo and the Falcons absolutely demolished the Raiders. DK Metcalf continues to beast and feast on opposing cornerbacks (go hawks). Metcalf sets a new season high in receiving yards for himself with 177. Meanwhile, Kyler Murray has his worst game of the season by far. This marks the first time Murray has dropped below 20 points. Travis Kelce’s three game streak of 20+ points ends this week, but Chris Godwin starts up a three game streak of 12+ points. It was enough for Eugene to get a big win going into the last fantasy regular season week. Kingdom Doodoo got good production from its prince, Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes threw for 3 touchdowns and 462 yards, 31.28 points. Mike Evans scores two touchdowns for 18.5 points. Evan’s buddy Rob Gronkowski had his busiest day of the season with 106 receiving yards, a season high for Gronk. WR KJ Hamler was an interesting choice as the Broncos had no QBs… Hamler had a whopping -0.8 points. The Washington D/ST dominated the Cowboys on Thanksgiving day and has put up back to back 10+ points. Miles can catch any team off guard. For the final fantasy regular season game, here comes The Shady Bunch.

|     **I need Moore points**      |**132.6**     |  EBDB BnB |   73.34   |

Junghwan gets the win over EBDB BnB and in high fashion. Junghwan got his points and is this week’s highest scoring team. More on Junghwan’s performance below. Andrew and his EBDB BnB put up a bad week. Andrew usually keeps his BnB in tip top shape but this week not so much. No hail mary touchdown for DeAndre Hopkins this week with just five catches for 55 yards. Andrew’s RBs didn’t add much help this week. Ezekiel Elliot and Kareem Hunt combine for 8.6 points. Both Robert Woods and Robert Tonyan both have good games for 12.3 and 15.2 points respectively. Andrew is hoping Adam Thielen can come back for the playoffs, he may need the extra firepower. Andrew has a playoff spot locked up already, he looks to hold on to his first round bye in week 13 against Yoon Pooned.

|     **2 Girls 1 Kupp**      | **108.5**   |  Carroll’s A Coward|   102.32   |

Dang Danny continues his streak. Danny hasn’t lost a game since week 4 and has now tied the longest win streak put up by EBDB BnB. To make things more savage, Danny didn’t even play a D/ST against Kyle. If he had played the D/ST on his roster, he would have scored 16 more points. A good trade to bring Antonio Gibson. Gibson scored three touchdowns and rushed for 110 yards on Thanksgiving day. Gibson has eight touchdowns in the last six weeks which includes a bye week. AJ Brown continues his successful season with his second highest scoring fantasy game of the season, 23.8 points. Dalvin Cook has his worst game of the season, 8.2 points. Danny is rolling and has a chance to make it nine wins in a row next week against Anil. Kyle is looking at a must win situation in week 13. This week, he gets a great game out of Deshaun Watson with his best fantasy game of the season, 33.12 points. Amari Cooper hits 20+ points for just the second time this season. Colts D/ST was hit with COVID, injuries, AJ Brown and Derrick Henry. First time the Colts D/ST has dipped into negative point territory. Kyle will need not only a win but a huge point total to get into the playoffs. Next up for Carroll’s A Coward is DK’s Left Calf.

|     **OJ is my GM**      |**118.4**     |  Poop AUTO |   95.08   |

A big win for Anil and OJ to try and solidify his spot in the playoffs. One more win and Anil is in, one loss and a big Junghwan win could mean no playoffs for Anil. Tough loss for Kai but he isn’t out of the playoffs just yet. A win next week sets himself up for the last spot. Anil’s team had a good week. Three of Anil’s players scored at least 20 points. Those players were Kenyan Drake, Allen Robinson II, and Justin Jefferson. Clyde Edwards-Helaire took a bit of a step back from his 20 point performance last week and only puts up 4.4 this week. I still believe in 2020 MVP Russell Wilson despite his lackluster performances in the last few weeks. Wilson had a pedestrian 14.4 fantasy points this week. Anil and OJ’s team has performed well as of late, let’s see if they can keep it up. With a loss this week, Kai is no longer in full control of his playoff fate. He’ll for sure need a win next week and some teams to lose to get in. A strange week for Kai. His usual heavy hitters failed him this week. Alvin Kamara has cooled off since Drew Brees went down. Kamara this week only put up 5.7 points which was the first time this season he didn’t have double digits in fantasy points. Davante Adams has 15.1 points. For Adams, that’s on the low end of production. It was the other players Kai has that aren’t as consistent but all did fairly well. Dallas Godert, Brandin Cooks, and the Giants D/ST combine for 40 points. Josh Allen wasn’t much help either with just 15.48 points. If Kai’s supporting cast and his usual studs play well, I’m sure Kai will win in week 13 and in the playoffs… if he makes it.

|     **Smokin’ Herbs**      |**106.64**     |  The Shady Bunch |   96.1   |

Some controversy this week thanks to myself but it was all cleared up. Matt gets a win and practically seals his spot in the playoffs. Connor’s playoff hopes are gone now but he put up a good fight. Matt this week got a solid performance out of his team. James Robinson was the star as he put up 128 rushing yards and a touchdown, 24.4 points. Terry McLaurin has been having a good season so far. He’s just under 1,000 receiving yards and I feel like is getting no love from the media this year. With how horrible the NFC East is you would think they would highlight individual player success. McLaurin has translated to the number 14 WR in fantasy. Speaking of NFC East individual performers, the Giants rookie Wayne Gallman has stepped up big time. Gallman hasn’t dipped below 10 points since he was slotted in as the main RB. I expect the production of Matt’s team to continue. Especially with Austin Ekeler back from injury, watch out for Matt in the playoffs. Connor and The Shady Bunch had a shot. ESPN toyed with Connor this week. A win , a loss, a win a loss… eventually a loss. There were points left on the bench as D’Andre Swift didn’t play this week thanks to a concussion. All but one player that is eligible for that flex slot would have given Connor the win. Nick Chubb looks like a force out there and puts up 25.1 points this week. Chubb has only two games where he didn’t rush for 100+ yards and one of those games he got hurt. Injuries were a huge part of the lack of success for Connor’s team this season. Sometimes that’s just how the cookie crumbles. 


## Highest Scoring Team
**I need Moore points - Junghwan**\
**132.6 Points**\
**Best Player: Tyreek Hill WR - 51.4 Points**\
Damn Tyreek Hill went off\
Hill had over 100 yards and two touchdowns in the first quarter\
Junghwan went all in on Miami for D/ST and K and it paid off for 25 points combine\
Carson Wentz finally scores over 15 fantasy points\
Nyheim Hines 8 catches for 66 yards with 9 rushing yards for 13.5 points\
Todd Gurely II seemed to be hit with arthritis and was out\
Didn’t matter though cause Cheetah had enough yards and touchdowns for two, maybe three, players


## Lowest Scoring Team
**DK’s Left Calf - Zach**\
**59.42 Points**\
**Best Player: Taysom Hill QB - 17.52 Points**\
I’ll keep this short as you have been out of the playoffs for quite some time now\
A record for the LGED, the fifth time you have been the lowest scoring team\
Your team only out scored Tyreek Hill by 8.02 points\
You set a record low for the season last week\
However, you did play the right QB out of the three you have this week and you remind us to keep setting our lineups despite how well our teams are doing\
So for that, we thank you.


#### Good luck in week 13 you fucking degenerates
