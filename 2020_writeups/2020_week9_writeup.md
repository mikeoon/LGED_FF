# LGED 2020 Week-9 Recap: Playoff Hopes Dwindle

### whaddup

Scoring is back in the LGED for… half the league at least. We saw a good fight for top scorer this week. The league also saw six teams score under 90 points. Surprisingly one of those teams got what could arguably be the biggest win of the season thus far. 

A reminder that we have four regular season games remaining, time for those late season playoff pushes homies. Also, the trade deadline is November 27th.

And now, week 9

|     **Poop AUTO**      | **130.7**  |  I need Moore points |   105.88  |

Kai has snapped his losing streak against Junghwan. After four losses in a row, Kai finds himself back to his success he found at the beginning of the season. Just like Kai’s team, Josh Allen returned to form against the hawks. Allen hasn’t put up more than 25 points since Kai won his last game back in week 4. Allen had all day against the hawks with 415 passing yards, threw for three touchdowns and rushed for one, 36 points. Stefon Diggs got some of that yardage action with 118 receiving yards for 16.3 points. Devante Adams is a man on a mission since his return from his injury. Just twice this season, one of those games he left injured, he has scored less than 10 points. In the last three weeks, Adams is averaging 140 receiving yards, two touchdowns, and 31.07 points a game. Alvin Kamara took a bit of a back seat this week with his lowest fantasy output so far with 13.4 points. The Buccaneers D/ST got demolished on Sunday Night Football… I loved every moment of it. I don’t know about you guys, but Tampa Bay as a city has had enough sports success during COVID. Another tough loss for Junghwan. With some key byes this week to some of his WRs he did the best he could. Tyreek Hill catches two touchdowns for the second week in a row and scores a season high 28.6 fantasy points. Mister I need Moore Touchdowns, Todd Gurley II, finds the endzone again with just 53 rushing yards. Josh Jacobs has been a bit of a disappointment as Junghwan’s first pick of the draft (9th overall). Mark Andrews has fallen off. Andrews has three weeks this season with 10+ points… other than that he’s had five weeks of less than 5 points. Junghwan’s 49ers players combined scored 0.7 points. At least Drew Brees has been playing well as of late. Jason Sanders kicked his way to 14 points and a game winning field goal against the Cardinals (go hawks). Junghwan is still in it though, he’ll need a strong finish to get into the playoffs.

|     **Yoon Pooned**      | **102.56**  |  The Shady Bunch |   71.6 |

My team gets their second win a row against Connor and the Shady Bunch. Keenan Allen had a sore throat and was listed questionable with an illness. Tested negative multiple times for COVID. Sometimes I forget people can just get sick in the NFL and not be COVID. Allen was one of those players and was SICK this week with 103 receiving yards and a touchdown. Will Fuller V has added to his touchdown streak to make it six weeks. Allen and Fuller are finding success in different ways. Allen with large volumes of targets and receptions. Fuller with low targets and receptions. Both are top 10 fantasy WRs so far. Robby Anderson on the other hand had only caught one touchdown this season (week 1), 10.8 points this week. George Kittle is pretty much out for the season. Jonnu Smith must have been taking notes on my bench. Smith had just two catches for 32 yards and touchdowns, I’ll take it. Derrick Henry had his worst game of the season and his second time scoring under 10 points. Despite the Bills rolling on the hawks, Devin Singleterry got none of that action. Hopefully Chris Carson returns soon as next week Poop AUTO comes to town. Connor’s team is out of the playoffs after this week’s loss. Highest scorer this week for The Shady Bunch, Chase Claypool, 11.3 points. Tom Brady looked like he didn’t know who was on his team on Sunday Night Football as he threw three interceptions. D’Andre Swift has had some success the last five weeks averaging 13.36 points. The Lions might be the least talked about football team in the NFL. I have no idea what’s happening in Detroit. Tyler Lockett went from taking the number two WR spot on the hawks to being a complete decoy for DK Metcalf. When Lockett does get targeted eight or more times, he gets at least 13 fantasy points. At least Aaron Jones is back from injury, hopefully for the long term. Nick Chubb is rumored to soon, maybe even this week. Connor may not be in the running for the playoffs anymore, but if he plays his cards right, he could be looking at $10.

|     **Catch 22**      | **147.72**  |  Carroll’s A Coward |   77.84  |

Eugene for the second time this season is the highest scoring team of the week. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that he scored the highest this week when Christan McCaffrey returned. More on Eugene’s performance below. Both these teams are now 5 - 4. Kyle’s team, similar to Poop AUTO, started the league with four straight wins and have only won one of the last five. The injury to Saquon Barkely is still being felt. Ronald Jones II has been left to fill that void. Kyle hasn’t really found another RB. He’s looked to the past and picked up Frank Gore and Adrian Peterson, but they haven’t produced that well. The Dak Prescott injury has rippled a bit into Amari Cooper’s production. Cooper found some success this week with 10 fantasy points and the most since Andy Dalton went down. Calvin Ridley and Tevin Coleman were both hurt and didn’t play. Maybe Kyle forgot to set his lineup? There wasn’t much help on the bench and he did play the highest scoring team. Nice week to “forget”. Deshaun Watson has been the better QB for Kyle. Lamar Jackson seems to have regressed a bit… maybe for a late season push?? Still, despite playing two injured players, Kyle wasn’t the lowest scoring team...

|     **OJ is my GM**      | **89.4**  | EBDB BnB |   67.62  |

It. Is. Done. OJ said enough is enough and took down EBDB BnB. I guess Anil helped as well. I am stoked to announce that Andrew is also the lowest scoring team this week. His first loss and he put up a dud. Some low hanging fruit to rub in Andrew’s first loss in nine weeks, but fuck it. More on EBDB BnB’s first one star review below. It wasn’t pretty for Anil and OJ, but they got it done. I mean, any other team this week could have gotten it done, but the history books won’t remember that. Despite Russell Wilson throwing two interceptions and losing two fumbles, he still manages 22.1 points behind two passing touchdowns and his first QB sneak touchdown. Clyde Edwards-Helaire seems to still be the main RB for the Chiefs. Edwards-Helaire only carried the ball five times for a season low but did manage to catch a touchdown. Speaking of carries, Jerrick McKinnon quadrupled his carries for the 49ers from last week (3 to 12) and rushed for a touchdown, 14.3 points. Evan Engram had his third game this season with 10 targets. This time, Engram recorded a season high in fantasy with 13.3 points. Justin Jefferson seems to be a big boom or bust guy, but still managed an okay fantasy day with 7.9 points. Anil and OJ are also 5 - 4 with their sights on a playoff spot. Next week is another fellow 5 - 4 team, Catch 22.

|     **2 Girls 1 Kupp**      | **137.06**  |  Kingdom DooDoo |   81.78  |

Danny continues his hot streak to make it five straight dubs. Dalvin Cook does just that and keeps on cooking. Rushing for two touchdowns behind 206 yards on the ground and 46 receiving yards, 38.2 points. Cook has even been the main reason for Danny's success as of late. Cook did not play week 6 and was on bye week 7. Danny’s Atlanta duo of Matt Ryan and Julio Jones combined for 36.26 points. A.J. Brown must have some connection with these 2 Girls and 1 Kupp. When Brown scores a touchdown, 2 Girls 1 Kupp wins. Brown has at least one touchdown in the last five weeks. Prior to that? None.

I guess now that I have mentioned the Lions once, I have to keep it up. The Lions’ Marvin Jones Jr. has played well the last three weeks. Jones this week only caught three passes for 43 yards, but he did manage to score a touchdown. I’m happy for Danny and his team. Dark days may be ahead for Kingdom DooDoo. At 3 - 6, Miles will need to win out for a shot at the playoffs. Perfect time for Patrick Mahomes to catch fire like he has. Back to back 30+ point weeks for Mahomes. He’s making his run at the MVP spot that is destined for Russell Wilson. David Johnson got injured this week after suffering a concussion. I think it’s safe to say at this point that the Texans lost that trade with the Cardinals. Myles Gaskin was placed on IR. The Kingdom will be looking for RBs far and wide on the waivers this week. Miles’ faith in the Buccaneers failed him as the Bucc’s offense put up a whopping 0 points. They did break a record though, lowest number of carries in an NFL game with five. Cole Beasley this week didn’t get enough action in the slot. His defense however, decided they wanted to obliterate Russell Wilson with five sacks, two interceptions, and two fumble recoveries. Let’s see if Miles can bounce back week 10 against DK’s Left Calf.

|     **Smokin’ Herbs**      | **109.2**  |  DK’s Left Calf |   78.04  |

Matt is the fifth team at 5 - 4. Smart waiver wire pickups and team management has kept his squad from bombing. At the beginning of the season, he saw five of his more valuable players go down to injuries. Many of them have healed up at this point but some credit is due. Terry McLaurin has his second best fantasy game of the season with seven catches for 115 yards and a touchdown, 21 points. McLaurin is the 11th ranked WR in fantasy and that’s good value for being picked in the 5th round of the draft. DeeJay Dallas continues to impress for the hawks. Back to back double digit fantasy points for the rookie. At this point, Matt is hoping for Michael Thomas to be a fantasy playoff hero. Thomas is clearly not at his usual form with just two games played and a total of 10.8 fantasy points. Aaron Rodgers got the start over Justin Herbert for Smokin’ Herbs. Rodgers has done well so far in fantasy. I feel like Rodgers always disappoints whoever drafts him a bit, but not this season. Undrafted in our fantasy league, James Robinson has been a big help to Matt. Robinson currently sits as the 4th RB in fantasy and put up 15.9 points this week. Things are going well for Matt, let’s see next week against EBDB BnB. Zach’s team has just been under performing this season. JuJu Smith-Schuster hasn’t really been the guy he was last year. Smith-Schuster did find the endzone along with 93 receiving yards. Melvin Gordon has just been okay. Gordon’s main issue has been consistency and drinking? DJ Chark Jr. went big this week with seven catches for 146 yards and a touchdown, 24.1 points. Zach was hit with a heavy amount of players on bye this week. Their replacements didn't do that well with four of his starting players combining for just 14.2 points. Zach may be out of the playoffs but I have confidence he’ll snag $10.


## Highest Scoring Team
**Catch 22 - Eugene**\
**147.72 Points**\
**Best Player: Kyler Murray QB - 37.92 Points**\
Second time this season huh?\
Christan McCaffrey had you waiting but came back in a big way\
McCaffrey had 151 yards from scrimmage, 10 catches, one rushing and one receiving touchdown… was this guy even injured??\
DK Metcalf is a beast out there (go hawks) with his fourth 100+ yard receiving game\
Metcalf is the number two WR in fantasy (go hawks)\
Travis Kelce hits 20.9 points in back to back weeks\
Kyler Murray was high on draft rankings and it has come to fruition\
This was Murray’s highest scoring week and his third time scoring 30+ points\
Eugene is just praying CMC doesn’t get hur…. nevermind


## Lowest Scoring Team
**EBDB BnB - Andrew**\
**67.62 Points**\
**Best Player: Ryan Tannehill QB - 14.62 Points**\
You know, I may have lied a bit last week\
I am yolked you lost and you find yourself in the roast\
None of your guys this week recorded a rushing or receiving touchdown\
None of your receivers recorded more than 45 yards\
Your leader this week in receptions? Joshua Kelley, RB with five\
Actually your RBs and WRs tied in number of receptions at eight each\
DeAndre “Puke” Hopkins with just three catches for 30 yards\
Your three highest scoring players combine? 34.92\
That’s three points lower than Kyler Murray this week alone\
I’m honestly surprised Ryan Tannehill even scored 14.62 points… the guy had a pass completion percentage of 47.6%\
Ezekiel Elliot is just a shell of himself and is now on your bench???\
Antonio Brown is messing up your team chemistry and the Buccaneers’\ 
However, you did bench Zeke which ended up being the right play reminding us that bold moves can be... rewarded?\
So for that, we thank you.


#### Good luck in week 10 you fucking degenerates
