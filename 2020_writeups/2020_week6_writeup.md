# LGED 2020 Week-6 Recap: The Founding of Club 4 - 2

### whaddupp

With week 6 in the books, we are about half way through this year’s regular season. It has flown by. The playoff picture is beginning to round out but we have a lot more regular season left. 


Wanted to take a second to remind you all to vote. Don't be like Tom and forget.

Week 6 brought the most lopsided scores on average for each matchup. Teams must be getting a better feel for who to start and sit each week… or not. Four teams sit at 4 - 2 and one team is still undefeated leaving the 6th playoff spot still up for grabs. Still too early to call, like I said, a lot more regular season left.

Let’s get into week 6.


| W            |         | L       |      |

|     **Catch 22**      |**117.82**     |  Kingdom DooDoo |   80.5     |
Eugene is one of the members of Club 4 - 2 after defeating DooDoo King Miles. Younghoe Koo just kicked the lights out for 20 points this week. Makes me sad every week I don’t get to slot him as my kicker. Chris Godwin comes back from injury with a meh welcome back game with 5 catches for 48 yards. Travis Kelce maintains his spot as the number one TE with a 2 TD performance. Kyler Murray dazzled against the Cowboys in the second Monday Night Football game. Murray currently sits as the top rank QB through 6 weeks and so far this year’s number one player in fantasy. He’s averaging 26.4 per game despite throwing 6 picks. Murray has rushed for a TD every game so far. He is just 0.2 points above the hero of Kingdom DooDoo, Patrick Mahomes. Miles’ team struggled this week a bit at WR. Mike Evans and T.Y. Hilton combined for 3.1 points... Which were pretty much erased by the Bills D/ST putting up -2. Rob Gronkowski finally got to Gronk smash as he had 5 catches for 78 yards and a TD, his first TD of the season. Gronk’s targets have steadily gone up for the past 3 weeks, maybe he’s finally finding his old form. RBs David Johnson and Myles Gaskin put up solid numbers. Miles is hoping one of the two has a breakout game that can put his team over the top. Back to Patrick Mahomes, he ranks 2nd among QB’s and number 2 overall in fantasy. He has not had a performance lower than 20 points. With rounding, he’s actually averaging the same as Kyler Murray. But, Eugene got Murray in the 6th round… and well, you know the rest.

|     **Post Mahomes**      |**86.4**     |  The Shady Bunch|   59.04    |
Connor and the bunch are the lowest scoring team of the week. Anything below 60 is rough. More on the shady performance below. Matt didn’t have a spectacular week either, but he got the job done against the lowest scoring team. Matt’s whole bench didn’t play due to bye weeks, injuries, and a new signing. Aaron Rodgers fresh off the bye week and fired up delivers 3.8 points. Rodgers completed 45.7% of his passes for 160 yards and two interceptions. James Conner has been good as of late. He is on a TD streak that has lasted four weeks now. Phillip Lindsay returns just in time as Melvin Gordon III gets a DUI and puts up 101 yards. Lindsay’s counterpart, Tim Patrick also puts up 101 yards, crazy. James Robinson does less from scrimmage than he did last week, but managed to find the endzone for 13.3 points. We all know Le’Veon Bell joined the Chiefs this week, I’m sure Matt can’t wait for his debut. He may need it next week, as Poop AUTO comes to town.

| **2 Girls 1 Kupp** | **121.18** | Carroll’s A Coward | 110.94 |
The closest matchup this week with a difference of 10.24 points. Danny follows up his first W with another one. A few trades, players back from injury, and Danny’s team is back in it. New acquisition Ben Roethlisberger has his lowest fantasy point total so far. He only threw the ball 22 times. Meanwhile, benched Matt Ryan goes off on Danny’s bench for 31.64. Danny still reaped the rewards from Matty Ice’s performance through Julio Jones who returns from injury to have his best game of the year: 8 catches for 137 yards and 2 TDs. Davlin Cook was missed, but at least Danny picked up Alexander Mattison… but he isn’t exactly Cook and only gets 3.5 points. AJ Brown has put up good numbers in the last two weeks (17.1 last week and 20.1 this week). Things are looking good for 2 Girls 1 Kupp. Although Dalvin Cook does need to return as both Danny’s RBs this week combined for 11 points. A slight skid for Kyle, his second straight loss. But it did allow him access to Club 4 - 2. This time, Lamar Jackson got back into form and put up 108 rushing yards and a rushing TD. Jackson has his best game of the season with 28.24 fantasy points. Ronald Jones II follows suit and punches in 2 TDs himself for 25.1 points. I may have jinxed Kyle’s D/ST and K Colts combo. This week, the two only combined for 11 points. Jaguars receiver Laviska Shenault Jr. only has 10 yards on 3 catches. Mark Ingram II didn’t do as well as his Raven’s teammate Lamar Jackson. It might be time to start Frank Gore in his place. Kyle and Danny are two teams that are trending in opposite directions, we’ll see what happens in week 7 as Danny plays Anil and Kyle plays Zach.

| **OJ is my GM** | **151.72** | Poop AUTO | 99.08 |
Anil and OJ are the highest scoring team this week. The last minute highest scoring crown was given on Monday Night Football thanks to kenyan Drake. More on the performance below. Welcome Poop AUTO to Club 4 - 2. Kai’s first week not reaching 100+ points. No Alvin Kamara this week may have had something to do with it. Josh Allen’s down week didn’t help but he didn’t do horribly with 15.08 points. Mike Davis had his lowest fantasy point total since the Christian McCaffrey injury. Jonathan Taylor continues to be steady, no breakout performance just yet but it may be coming. Stefon Diggs has only one game where he either didn’t go for 100+ receiving yards or a TD, this week it was the latter. Waiver wire pickup Brandin Cooks grabs a TD in a shootout between the Titans and Texans. Kai’s three Packers combined for 17.1 points. One of those players being Davante Adams who just returned from injury. Once Alvin Kamara gets back from the bye week and Adams finds his form, Poop AUTO may return to its winning ways. For now, it’s the second loss in a row. Two losses never hurt… right?

| **Yoon Pooned** | **141.42** | DK’s Left Calf | 91.92 |
My team rolls for its third game in a row and I also find myself in Club 4 - 2. Derrick Henry continues his campaign for the season rushing yard crown as he puts up 212 yards on the ground with 2 TDs. He added 2 catches for 52 yards as a cherry on top. Henry really carried the slack for my other RB, Devin Singletary who just managed 5.0 points. George Kittle and Will Fuller V both had 20+ games with 232 receiving yards and 2 TDs combined. In the five week prior, my D/ST slot has averaged -.02 points. Streamed the Giants D/ST and they came through with 13.0 stifling the Washington Football Team. Next week brings EBDB BnB and hoooooo how bad I want to win that one. Zach’s squad had a solid week. Again, no one on Zach’s team really broke out. His best player this week was Joe Mixon with 13.9 points. All but two players on his team had 10 or more points. David Montgomery and Logan Thomas both put up 11.7 points for the week. JuJu Smith-Schuster is finding himself one of many talented receivers in Pittsburgh and hasn’t shined. DJ Chark Jr. has been on a downward trend since his 25.5 performance in week 4. Miles Sanders, arguably Zach’s best player, picked up a knee injury and is expected to be out a few weeks. With three QB’s on the roster, Zach must be looking for more production there. Hopefully Melvin Gordon III can clean up a bit and return to the field. Zach may need to make some trades and key waiver wire moves to position himself for a playoff spot. There is still time for a mid season surge. 


## Highest Scoring Team
**OJ is my GM - Anil**\
**151.72 Points**\
**Best Player: Justin Jefferson WR - 35.1 Points**\
Damn, Kenyan Drake’s 69 yard TD run with 1:49 on the clock in the 4th quarter\
Kirk Cousins threw three interceptions but also threw three TDs\
Anil’s trade for WR Justin Jefferson paid off big this week as Jefferson puts up 166 yards and 2 TDs\
With Cousins, Jefferson, and Drake combined is only 11.86 points less than your opponent (Poop AUTO with 99.08)\
Clyde Edwards-Helaire making his case to maintain the lead RB role in Kansas City before Le’Veon Bell suits up\
Edwards-Helaire with 161 rushings yards\
This was all done with 2020 MVP Russell Wilson on a bye week\
Keep it up OJ


## Lowest Scoring Team
**The Shady Bunch - Connor**\
**59.04 Points**\
**Best Player: Chase Claypool WR - 16.1 Points**\
Welcome back\
Your Dolphin duo that doomed you on your first roast returns for a combined 5.0 points\
Don’t worry, the Rams D/St and Greg Zuerlein combine for 2.0\
Odell Beckham Jr. put up just 3.5 points more than injured Nick Chubb\
Your bench with only three active players scored 9.64 points less than your whole starting roster\
At least Aaron Jones found the endzone, otherwise he only put up 41 yards from scrimmage\
Without your two top scorers, D’Andre Swift only had 2.5 points less than the rest of the seven players on your starting roster combined\
Your best player this week was just picked off the waiver wire\
I’m not sure whether to congratulate you or just be disappointed\
However, you remind us that there are plenty of gems left on the waiver wire and to stay active\
So for that, we thank you.


#### Good luck in week 7 you fucking degenerates
