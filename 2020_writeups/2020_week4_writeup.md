Sorry boys for the slight delay in this week's writeup. Here we are sitting a third way through the fantasy league regular season and it looks like COVID wants to play. I will say we will go as the fantasy football app on ESPN goes. If the matchups continue, we do too.

Week 4 we saw continued success and lack thereof. The standings are starting to take shape and it’s looking like one division is better than the other.

We’ve had some suggestions for a possible league podcast. I like the idea and we’ll see if we can get something going. If you guys have other suggestions feel free speak up, more activity is always a plus

Let's get into week 4.


**EBDB BnB (129.38)** vs DK’s Left Calf (121.14)\
It’s a family affair when DK’s Left Calf stays at the EBDB BnB. For those who don’t know, Zach and Andrew are brothers. Andrew comes away with the win to remain undefeated. The Cowboys duo of Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot is annoyingly good in fantasy. Adam Thielen has started to show up and is letting everyone know it’s not just Dalvin Cook on the Vikings. DeAndre Hopkins has his first game where he didn’t either catch a TD pass or have 130+ receiving yards. Kareem hunt has found a home on the Browns and found the endzone twice in a 7 TD game for the Browns. The rest of Andrew’s team had a pretty pedestrian week. This was Andrew’s first week not scoring 130+ points. EBDB has a big match against Poop AUTO in week 5. Zach was tired of the roast last week and bounced back big. Unfortunately, it was just short of a win. Best performance by far for Zach’s squad. Joe Mixon went off, 181 yards from scrimmage, 2 rushing TD’s and 1 receiving TD for 39.1 points. Mixon more than doubled his total point output thus far. If Zach had started Melvin Gordon who played on that sorry Thursday Night Football game, he would have won and almost the highest scoring title. DJ Chark Jr. had a game similar to his performances last season as he grabbed 2 TD’s for 22.5 points. Positive performances nonetheless from DK’s Left Calf, maybe he can grab a win next week as 2 Girls 1 Kupp comes to town. 


**Yoon Pooned (146.8)** vs I need Moore points (97.68)\
My team is the highest scoring team of the week. By far my team’s best performance. Feels good... but only 2 wins total. More on the out of nowhere highest scoring performance below. Junghwan receives his third loss in a row. In those losses, he’s lost by 20+ points and this week being his largest defeat so far. His team is a bit out of rhythm. The players on his team are not playing well on the same week. Mark Andrew’s has duds but this week has the highest on the team with 19.2 points. Josh Jacobs has been a shell of himself since his week 1 blow up. Todd Gurley II just hasn’t been consistent, his success is solely based on TD’s. Junghwan’s top 2 WRs have been solid (Cooper Kupp and Tyreek Hill), but no real breakout performances. We’ll see if Junghwan can get some Moore points and some swagger back next week as he plays Anil’s team.


**OJ is my GM (95.5)** vs Kingdom DooDoo (85.54)\
Miles’ first week as the lowest scoring team. The Kingdom’s hero did his best to save him from the roast. More on the DooDoo performance below. Anil and his leader(?) OJ secured their second win of the season. Russell Wilson has a good game but not the 30+ points we were expecting to see at this point. Allen Robinson followed up his season high in fantasy points with his second most ,19.6 points. Maybe the Bears found their QB in Nick Foles? Nah, they only scored 11 points. Jerick Mckinnon seems to be the RB for the 49ers and just got a boost with Raheem Mostert out. One of Anil’s other RB’s, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, is going steady. Both of these RBs are 11th and 13th ranked so far this season among RBs. Some points left on the bench with Antonio Gibson (20.8), but Anil and OJ didn’t need the help.


**Carroll’s A Coward (104.22)** vs Post Mahomes (100.18)\
Kyle had to be sweating a little bit near the end of this matchup. Calvin Ridley with the surprising goose egg for the week. Brandin Cooks also joined him in the goose egg department. Lamar Jackson and Amari Cooper combined to give Kyle just about half his points, 52.42.Colts D/ST continues to be one of the only trustworthy options to play at the D/ST slot. Through the first 4 weeks they are the number 1 fantasy defense. Ronald Jones II has his best game of the season (15.8) as Leonard Fournette did not play. Kyle and the crew are undefeated with a matchup against Yoon Pooned next. Damn, The injuries just don’t stop for Matt. Austin Ekeler left the game on sunday early with a hamstring injury. With a COVID bye for James Connor, that left Matt with 5 players not playing this week. Regardless, Matt still put up a fight. Aaron Rodgers on Monday Night Football tried to drag the squad to the W but fell short. Rodgers finished with 29.58 and that puts him as the number 5 fantasy QB. Dalton Shultz (TE for the Cowboys, I got you reader) was a great pickup. James Robinson couldn’t continue his Thursday Night Football magic but managed to get 100+ yards from scrimmage. Terry McLaurin, the man who we laughed at last year is showing he belongs in the league. Michael Thomas should be returning to bolster Matt’s team as he sits at .500.


**Poop AUTO (97.02)** vs Catch 22 (93.72)\
Another primetime matchup for Poop AUTO to reach 4 - 0. It again came down to Monday Night Football. Essentially, Kai needed Mason Crosby and Marquez Valdes-Scantling to outscore Travis Kelce on Eugene’s Catch 22. Crosby has been playing well, Valdes-Scantling hasn’t shown much since week 1. They combined on MNF for a whopping 13.5 for the W. Kai’s combo of Josh Allen and Alvin Kamra is explosive accounting for most of Kai’s success so far. Tyler Boyd has been a nice little steal of the draft (round 6), he ranks 17th among WRs in fantasy football. There is always room for improvement though. This was Poop AUTO’s lowest scoring output, I smell a slump coming… or it’s week 5 matchup EBDB BnB. Both of whom are 4 - 0. Eugene finds himself in pretty low scoring territory after his highest scoring performance last week. Injuries were felt as the likes of J.D. McKissic and Hunter Renfrow don’t really add up to Christian McCaffrey and Chris Godwin. Darrell Henderson Jr. was hot coming into week 4, but fell flat in a pretty ugly game between the Giants and the Rams. Eugene did benefit from the ugly affair with the Rams D/ST with 12 points. The Cardinals may be reeling but Kyler Murray is playing at a high clip. Jamison Crowder may be the only relevant fantasy player on the Jets. All I want? DK Metcalf to continue balling and Eugene getting L’s.


**The Shady Bunch (122.16)** vs 2 Girls 1 Kupp (103.8)\
THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. The matchup of the season so far. Two teams trying to find a taste of sweet victory for the first time this season. Connor and The Shady Bunch find a way to grab their first win against the still winless Danny and his 2 Girls and 1 Kupp. This matchup was going to get dirty so naturally Odell Beckham Jr. went off for 3 TDs, 81 receiving yards and 73 rushing yards. Tom Brady couldn’t let the bunch down and his first “I ain’t retired yet” performance of the year (he still managed to throw a pick though) with 32.46 points. Aaron Jones is still producing and so far is the number 2 RB in fantasy. All thanks to Jones’ week 2 performance of 42 points... Somehow Connor still doesn’t get the win there. Oh well, he’s got one now. Danny is the sole winless team in the league. To be completely fair, leading up to week 4, he has lost to the highest scoring team twice and the 2nd highest scoring team once. Not much you can really do there. Both these teams have been pretty unlucky, unfortunately Danny finds himself still unlucky. Dalvin Cook is a stud and Mike Davis has stepped up and delivered in the absence of Christian McCaffrey. Julio Jones has been hurt or quiet since week 1. Kenny Golladay though has been nice since suiting up week 3 with back to back 14 point performances. Danny’s team is just a bit inconsistent, but what we do know, his lack of luck is consistent. Up next is DK’s Left Calf and another shot at 2020 season’s first win.


## Highest Scoring Team
**Yoon Pooned - Mike**\
**146.8 points**\
**Best Player: George Kittle TE - 32.6 points**\
Mannn I am 100% letting COVID be the new GM of my team\
George Kittle comes back from injury with an awesome performances on Sunday Night Football despite no Jimmy G\
Chris Carson injured?? You wouldn’t have been able to tell. Carson found the endzone twice and looked good with 23.5 points\
Will Fuller V should have had a 2nd TD to cap off his best performances of the season at the end of Vikings Texans\
I neglected Robby Anderson up until week 4 and he was happy to get the opportunity and had a nice game\
Sadly though, I had to drop my guy Younghoe Koo. Those sad feelings quickly left as my waiver wire pick up Randy motherfucking Bullock comes in with 17 points\
Let’s see if I can continue this success… probably not but I’ll take the $10

## Lowest Scoring Team
**Kingdom DooDoo - Miles**\
**85.54 points**\
**Best Player: Mike Evans WR - 21.7 points**\
Patrick Mahomes couldn’t save you this week\
You should probably check your player’s updates as Leonard Fournette was ruled out on Friday\
Just bench or drop T.Y. Hilton, the man has 22.7 points on the season which is just 1 point more than what Mike Evans scored this week alone\
Darren Waller is solid, so why do you have 2 more TE’s on the bench?\
Mo Alie-Cox? I mean his name is pretty hilarious and he’s out scoring Hilton… Yeah you should keep him\
Rob Gronkowski?? Why is he still on your team??? Tom Brady has moved on and just got him to un-retire for the video content the Buccaneers are shamelessly putting out\
Like I said, Patrick Mahomes tried, but it’s not a good look when your backup QB, Derek Carr, outscores him on the bench\
I can’t hate on Myles Gaskin, Go Dawgs.\
Elliot Fry was a sneaky play as Younghoe Koo was injured, but looking ahead to week 5 he’s already listed as a free agent\
Your team kind of looks like there are 14 teams in the league\
However, you constantly remind us to not draft a QB round 1\
So for that we thank you.


#### Good luck in Week 5 you fucking degenerates.
