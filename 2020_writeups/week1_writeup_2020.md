# LGED 2020 Week-1 Recap: COVID Ain't Stopping Us

### whaddupp

It is good to be back boys. Honestly, I wasn't sure if the NFL was gonna get their shit together and get this season going let alone on time. This is our third season in a row and I'm happy to announce we have some new GM's among us. Andrew and Miles join the list of degenerates. 


As a reminder what these writeups are about, every week I try to write about all the matchups. We reward the highest scoring team with some praise and $10, while the lowest scoring team gets a little roast at the bottom of the writeup.


Without further ado, here is the writeup for Week 1

**I need Moore points (121.0)** Vs Kingdom DooDoo (89.4)\
Out the gate and Junghwan comes out swinging. After Josh Jacobs’ 1,150 rushing yard rookie season, he looks to repeat that and more with a killer week 1 performance. Jacobs has already reached about a third of his receiving yards from last season, look out. Mark Andrews gets the mark for highest scoring TE in our league (0.2 points behind waiver wire man Dallas Goedert). It may be the Drew Brees retirement lap and it seemed that way with an okay 14.4 performance. Brees didn’t have to do much with Tom Brady’s wack debut for the Buccaneers. Everyone welcome Miles to the league, King of Kingdom DooDoo. Miles must have been also expecting more from the Bucs, he drafted 3 of their skill guys, Mike Evans, Rob Gronkowski, Leonard Fournette. Hilariously, out of those three Miles benches Evans who has more points than Gronk and Fournette combined thanks to a late TD grab. At least Mile’s first round draft pick Patrick Machomes came through? 20.44 for the reigning Super Bowl MVP.


**Poop AUTO (128.18)** Vs 2 Girls 1 Kupp (111.9)\
Poop AUTO returns with maybe a bit less auto?? Doesn’t matter, Kai has calibrated and put up a big week. Davante Adams looked real nice with 34.6. The Packers just marched all up and down the field against the Vikings which happened to be his defense (-9 points) didn’t matter, nice comfortable lead. Josh Allen despite just fumbling it right to ex-seahawk Bradley McDougald, Allen played a hell of a game throwing and running the ball (2 passing TD’s and 1 rushing TD). Alvin Kamara continues to benefit from the Saints’ passing game with just 16 yards rushing. Kai has a raffle ticket in the Indianapolis Colts RB contest in Jonathan Taylor. Taking notes from Auto Draft has helped, Kai is set up for success. Funny how Danny mostly auto drafted and played Poop AUTO week 1.  Danny had a solid week, pretty much played his team to its full potential. Matt Ryan kept throwing to his guy Julio Jones and both combined for 44.1 points against the Hawks. Matty Ice had 450 passing yards with 157 of them going to Jones. Dalvin Cook scored big behind 2 rushing TDs while Cam Akers may not be the guy just yet in LA. Maybe Danny just wanted to take notes like Kai did this year from Auto Draft.

**EBDB BnB (150.24)** Vs Catch 22 (142.1)\
Man, not every week you see the matchup between the highest scoring team of the week vs the second highest scoring team. EBDB BnB EBDB BnB BnB EBDB BDBEBDB fuuuuuck i couldn’t stop saying Andrew’s team name, really got to me. Congrats Andrew for being the highest scoring team this week and welcome to the league. More on EBDBDBEBE BnB’s performance below. Eugene had the pleasure of watching a slow train wreck after the slate of afternoon games on Sunday. He put up a comfortable 67.04 lead going into SNF and MNF. I honestly thought he had it in the bag. Boom, 15 yard catch Robert Woods. Boom, Dak Prescott TD pass to Ezekiel Elliot. Bang, Noah Fant TD catch. Eugene was done. Not all bad news though. He put up a pretty monster week thanks to Kyler Murray (little dude can ball), Christian McCaffrey (Doing Run CMC things) and Raheem Mostert (76 yard receiving TD) combining for 76.3 points. DK Metcalf with the 4th down TD grab (go hawks) and a great outing for him in his second season with 95 receiving yards and a TD on 4 catches. Metcalf did have some bad drops but hopefully that’s COVID’s fault for no pre-season and less practice. Don’t give up Eugene, not every loss will sting this bad.

**DK’s Left Calf (87.28)** vs The Shady Bunch (83.26)\
Connor and the Shady Bunch are the lowest scoring team of the week. It was a close one with Zach’s team putting in the final touches to his win on MNF. We’re roasting Connor and the bunch below. Thanks to a good performance from JuJu Smith-Schuster on Big Ben’s return to play and Melvin Gordon III’s debut for the Broncos, Zach finds himself a W and not lowest scoring of the week. With Phillip Lindsay banged up, maybe Gordon continues to produce. Miles Sanders didn’t suit up week 1 and gives zach 0 points, possibly a late scratch or Zach just wanting to keep it interesting between his team and the Shady Bunch. Joe Mixon fumbled and Kevin Harlan (the game announcer) had a field day yelling “HE NEVER FUMBLES”. Maybe Kevin Harlan also has him on his fantasy football squad. DK’s Left Calf gets the W this week but looks to improve week 2.

**Yoon Pooned (94.2)** vs Post Mahomes (84.66)\
My squad gets the W with everything on the line going into MNF. It was lined up for James Conner on Matt’s squad vs Derrick Henry on mine. Annnnd James Connor in the 2nd quarter leaves the game with an ankle injury, pretty much sealing it for last year’s rushing champ Henry to lead my team to victory. Yoon Pooned had a pretty soft week, Chris Carson put the team on his back with 2 receiving TD’s (go hawks) and Will Fuller V trying to do his best Deandre Hopkins impression in Huston with 112 yards on 8 catches. Not a very good impression but he tried. My boy Younghoe Koo misses a PAT, but knocks down 2 field goals and another onside kick. The Koo onside kick tracker is on this season, 1/1, lets fucking go. James Conner was not the only injury for Post Mahomes. Michael Thomas had an ankle injury as well near the end of the game. Le’Veon Bell was put on IR after his game and Phillip Lindsay also got injured in his game. The one bright spot for Matt and his squad was Aaron Rogers with 30.76. Matt will have to do some serious waiver wire damage control for week 2, but hey, at least he didn’t draft Aaron Rogers in the first round? Don’t count him out.

**Carroll’s A Coward** (110.9) vs OJ is my GM (96.78)\
OJ and Anil are back and week 1, get the L. This match up had the 2019 MVP and the MVP runner up going head to head. Lamar Jackson may have won the MVP, but Russell Wilson had the better week 1 (go hawks, very low hanging fruit I know). It wasn’t enough to get OJ and Anil the W. Kyle’s team had a good week behind Calvin Ridley’s 130 yards and 2 TD game for 29.4 points. Saquon Barkely comes out flat in week 1. Austin Seibert, Kyle’s kicker, may have been paid by OJ to miss everything and try to bring Kyle’s score down. For Anil, the week looked good on TNF. Chiefs rookie RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire (the H is silent you uncultured swines) puts up pretty good numbers with 19.8 points. I did a deep dive to see how well this ranked among Chiefs' running backs fantasy performances for week 1. Edwards-Helaire ranks 3rd in the last 10 years. 

Here is the breakdown:

| Rank | Year | Name                  | Fantasy Points|
|:----:|:-----|:----------------------|:--------------|
| 1    | 2017 | Kareem Hunt           |43.1           |
| 2    | 2016 | Spencer Ware          |29.4           |
| 3    | 2020 | Clyde Edwards-Helaire |19.8           |
| 4    | 2015 | Jamaal Charles        |18.8           |
| 5    | 2013 | Jamaal Charles        |17.5           |
| 6    | 2010 | Jamaal Charles        |16.5           |
| 7    | 2011 | Jamaal Charles        |13.0           |
| 8    | 2019 | LeSean McCoy          |9.8            |
| 9    | 2012 | Jamaal Charles.       |8.7            |
| 10   | 2018 | Kareem Hunt           |4.9            |

Future looks bright for the kid. Strange, at that point in my life where about half the players are younger than me now. We’re getting old. Seems like OJ told Anil the wrong pick at the flex with Darius Slayton putting up 25.2 points on the bench. Maybe OJ just needs some time to warm up.



## Highest Scoring team
**EBDB Bnb - Andrew**\
**150.54 points**\
**Best Player: Adam Thielen WR - 28.0 points**\
150+ points for week 1, hell of a bar set for the rest of the season\
Only one spot on Andrew’s roster didn’t have at least 10 points, Eagles D/ST\
The Cowboys combo of Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot worked well in an otherwise boring SNF game\
Andrew’s WR alone, DeAndre Hopkins and Adam Thielen putting up a third of his team’s points for a combined 50.1\
Noah Fant looking like good value as a draft pick in the 9th round\
And Robert Woods wins round 1 against Cooper Kupp in more fantasy points for the Rams WR’s\
Things looking real EBEDBEE for EBDB BnB


## Lowest Scoring Team
**The Shady Bunch - Connor**\
**83.26 pts.**\
**Best player: Tom Brady QB - 20.46 pts.**\
First roast of the season and my fingers are twitching with excitement\
You put a lot of faith in the Browns drafting Nick Chubb and Odell Beckham Jr. who combined for 8.8 points\
Apparently OBJ loves playing like and with shit\
Didn’t know you were Dolphins guy\
Mike Gesicki and DeVante Parker with 11.2, just barely clearing the Browns duo bar\
Your best player outscores those 4 players combine (20.46 to 20.0)\
Don’t think you can hide Jordan Howard, your third Dolphins player, on the bench\
Legatron really hasn’t been the same and as transformed back to Greg Zuerlien\
Tom Brady managed to scrounge to get some points for the bunch, but looked kind of sorry out there\
Tyler Lockett… My guy, can’t say a single bad thing about him. Dude is a saint (go hawks)\
You could have randomly played someone on your bench in your flex instead of Devante Parker and you would’ve had an 80% chance to put up the same or more points than you did saving yourself from lowest scoring\
However, you did remind us that playing multiple skill guys from the same team can burn you\
So for that, we thank you


#### Good Luck in Week 2 you fucking degenerates.
