# LGED 2020 Week-2 Recap: Injuries Creep in, Streaks Begin

### whaddupp
Week 2 came in a hurry. We saw a slew of injuries plague the league, big names too. Some for short periods of time, others for the rest of the season. You can’t help but think player’s bodies aren’t regular season ready with the lack of practice, training, and preseason games. ACL’s are popping left and right.

If you haven’t noticed already, I have moved the writeups here for better readability and shareability. Email formatting was hot trash. Look for this baby webpage to grow as the season goes.

This week we saw winning and losing streaks begin. A new record for lowest scoring and highest scoring. On to the writeup.




**EBDB Bnb (153.5)** vs 2 Girls 1 Kupp (99.62)\
Back to back 150+ point performances for Andrew and is your scoring champion two weeks in a row. Let’s pray the Cowboys and Mike McCarthy start to implode as the Cowboys always seem to do so this streak doesn't continue. More on EBDB Bnb’s performance below. Danny comes into week 2 after a week 1 loss to the second highest scoring team. A spell of bad luck keeps Danny and his squad winless. Matt Ryan tried to help out but blew a lead to the very team that scored a good chunk of EBDB Bnb’s points. Matty Ice and the Falcons were up 15 in the 4th but couldn’t seal the deal. Unfortunately Ryan didn’t find Julio Jones much, which left Jones with a forgettable game. Dalvin Cook was the only bright spot in dim showing for the Vikings. Hunter Henry didn’t skip a step with rookie QB Justin Herbert stepping in. A.J. Green was pretty much nonexistent on TNF but at least was targeted more than he had in week 1. Back to back solid performances from Danny, his girls, and the kupp. Just some bad luck.


**Post Mahomes (141.6)** vs OJ is my GM (103.02)\
Boom, Matt bounces back big in week 2. Turns out his week 1 injuries weren’t too much of a problem, but who would have thought that? If I read to you that Matt’s team had Michael Thomas, Le’Veon Bell, and Phillip Linsday all out would you expect him to win? Probably not, but this is fantasy football and anything can happen. Terry McLaurin, Julian Edelman, and James Robninson doubled their point totals and more from week 1 to combine for 63.4 points. Aaron Rodgers came back down to earth but put up solid QB numbers. Mark Ingram II decided to actually play this week and broke off a 30 yard TD run. Matt also had the Ravens D/ST who shut out Deshaun Watson and the Texans. Like I said, don’t count Matt out. Anil and OJ remain winless in this young season. Without an MVP performance from Russell Wilson on SNF, Anil’s week would have been a lot worse. Wilson threw 5 TD’s to 5 different receivers which is what you just love to see (go hawks). Back to back weeks with 30 point fantasy performances. Anil and OJ got this one right. Okay performances across the board. Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Kenyan Drake had steady games but both couldn’t find the endzone. In fact, the only player who did on Anil’s team was Antonio Gibson. All of Anil’s players were used well in their respective games except for Allen Robinson. Sprinkle in some TD’s into that Anil and OJ, and the wins will start pouring in.


**Kingdom DooDoo (115.28)** vs Yoon Pooned (78.18)\
Miles, King of DooDoo gets the easy win over my team.The King of DooDoo comes in strong after a so-so performance in week 1 showing us his drafting skills weren’t all a bust. Miles plays the right combo of Tampa Bay Buccaneers players with Mike Evans and Leonard Fournette. Fournette moves 3.5 hours away to Tampa Bay and gets 103 yard and 2 TDs on 12 carries. Evans and Tom Brady started to click after that pretty underwhelming performance last week. Miles left Rob Gronkowski on the bench which was a good call as he saw just 1 target and recorded 0 points. TE Darren Waller put up almost triple his fantasy point output from last week. Jury is still out on Patrick Mahomes in the first round of the draft, but he hasn’t completely disappointed. Wow my team put up some sorry points. Thank god Russell Wilson threw that TD pass to Chris Carson. Carson was my highest scoring player by 1.3 points. Second highest? My fucking guy, Younghoe Koo. Looked like Koo was going to be my highest scoring player of the week. Carson Wents continues to throw picks. I foolishly selected Jimmy Graham as a streaming TD as George Kittle sat out for injury this week. Derrick Henry just had a pedestrian game but still saw 25 carries. There is some life on the bench for my squad, we’ll see if I can put it together next week. For this week, I bent the knee.


**Carroll’s A Coward (98.66)** vs I need Moore points (66.48)\
Junghwan’s squad is the lowest scoring team of the week. A low bar and a new record for this season. Junghwan had a chance to get Moore points on MNF and catch up to my abysmal performance, but fell short. More on Junghwan’s squad’s performance below. Kyle just coasts in week 2 for his 2nd win. Calvin Ridley showed that he was the best University of Alabama WR alum on the field. There were 2 other star-studded ones. Ridley put up 100+ receiving yards and his second week in a row with 2 TD’s. Ridley completely out shined fellow alum Julio Jones. The third Bama alum, also on Kyle’s team, Amari Cooper didn’t find the endzone but put up 100 yards on 6 catches for 13.0 points. Lamar Jackson had a standard fantasy QB game but cruised in the victory over the Texans. It wasn’t all good news for Kyle, Sqauon Barkely left the game with a knee injury and it has been confirmed it’s an ACL tear. Barkley is out for the season. Kyle may need to find some help at RB, he’s got only Frank Gore to fill that slot. Lucky for him, Le’veon Bell is out and FrakenGore could come up. We’ll see what Kyle does week 3.


**Catch 22 (127.54)** vs DK’s Left Calf (93.76)\
Eugene with a good win but had to sacrifice Christian McCaffrey for a few weeks. McCaffrey gave Eugene a parting gift (McCaffrey is out with a high ankle sprain for 4 - 6 weeks) of 22.8 points. We’ll see if he comes back in full as the Panthers aren’t that good in a deep division. Travis Kelce continues to produce as the star TE in Kansas City, dude doesn’t really slow down. Kelce recorded another TD and was targeted 14 times (he caught 9 of them). Raheem Mostert also suffered an injury and may miss a little bit of time but still managed to get Eugene a rushing TD and 100+ yards from scrimmage. Kyler Murray continues to razzle fucking dazzle. I can’t wait for the Hawks to play the dusty birds. The 2nd year QB is really doing it all this year with 2 rushing TD’s and 1 passing. Zach’s squad showed some improvement over last week’s win, but isn’t playing the lowest scoring this week. DK Metcalf going against DK’s Left Calf, I would say DK Metcalf won this round. Zach’s squad didn’t have any breakout fantasy performances to put him in a winning position. Miles Sanders did play this week and played well with a TD and 131 yards from scrimmage for 18.6 points. Melvin Gordon III managed to put up 1 more point than he did last week even with the absence of Phillip Linsday. Chief’s D/ST just letting the offense do the work with -1.0. David Montgomery played well but found himself on the bench with 20.2 points. It wouldn’t have been enough but that type of performance is what Zach was missing. Both teams walk away 1-1, it’s too early to read into anything.


**Poop AUTO (150.88)** vs The Shady Bunch (147.38)\
THE primetime matchup this week. Saved the best for last. Connor was looking to redeem himself after his week 1 roast. The Shady Bunch looked to not disappoint, but they did. Kai wins the matchup on MNF thanks to the Saints finding nothing else on offense but Alvin Kamara. Kamara was the star in a loss with 2 TDs and 174 yards from scrimmage with 9 catches, 33.9 points to lead Poop AUTO to sweet victory. Kamara wasn’t the only bright spot on Kai’s squad, Josh Allen trucking people in Miami while also throwing 4 TDs. Both DJ Moore and Tyler Boyd have good games and combine for 32.7 points. Jonathan Tayler looked to be the winner of the Colts RB lottery and lead the way with 101 yards on 26 carries and a TD. Unfortunately, Devante Adams got hurt in the second half of his game with a hamstring injury. Packers seem optimistic for him to play but it’s classic Adams already in week 2. I feel for The Shady Bunch, I really do. With that Adams injury, Aaron Jones put up a monster of a game for 45 points (168 yards rushing, 2 rush TDs, 68 receiving yards, 1 reception TD). Even the Browns duo Nick Chubb and Odell Beckham Jr. heard the roast last week and came out big in the battle of Ohio and put up 41.2 points. The leader of the bunch, Tom Brady had a mess of a game. Brady had another interception and even fumbled this time. Brady scrounged together 8.68 points. Mike Gesicki wanted to help out this time with 130 yards and TD. Which actually may have hurt Connor a bit as he did have the Bills D/ST going against Gesicki, the Bills D/ST wanted the shadyness to continue and put up -1.0. A different play at the flex may have saved Connor, but hard to argue with a 140+ point performance for the week. A roller coaster ride for sure for both GM’s. Connor and the bunch look to get their first win next week, against... EBDB BnB? Poop AUTO pushes on.



## Highest Scoring Team
**EBDB BnB - Andrew**\
**153.5 points**\
**Best Player: Dak Prescott QB - 39.8 points**\
Damn back to back highest scoring team and 150+ points\
Someone shut down this EBDB BnB, are you complying with COVID-19 cleaning procedure?\
Kareem Hunt balls out on TNF putting up a rushing and receiving TD for 23.1 points\
Looks like the Browns may have figured their shit out with their combo RB’s\
Noah Fant continues to produce despite who the Broncos have a QB\
Adam Thielen may be a dud, but with DeAndre Hopkins doing Nuke things it’s all good\
The real story here, despite Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot fumbling early, they managed to put together 39.8 and 19.2 point games respectively\
Robert Woods gets paid in the week and thanks the Ram with an alright performance, 10.3 points\
Harrison Butker kicks the game winning field goal for the Chiefs in OT to score 13.0 fantasy points\
How long is our stay at the EBDB BnB? I’m trying to checkout, maybe next week.

## Lowest Scoring Team
**I need Moore points - Junghwan**\
**66.48 points**\
**Best Player: Tyreek Hill WR - 19.3 points**\
Just to start, EBDB BnB had more than double your points\
I would have rather watched the fantasy matchup between your starting roster and your bench\
You would have barely won, 66.48 to 63.94\
Was Nyheim Hines even playing? He recorded 1 target 1 catch for 4 yards\
Emmanuel Sanders took the veterans day off on Monday Night Football\
Mark Andrews must have been tired after last week’s performance, he caught the ball once\
Those three players together barely outscored Todd Gurley II, 6.6 to 6.1\
You should be praising MNF, that game alone got you almost half your points\
It was looking abysmal before then with just 37.7\
It’s never good when a rookie QB, Joe Burrow, on your bench outscores ⅔’s of your team combine 24.54 to 20.7 \
Things were looking good on Thursday Night Football with Tyreek Hill scoring 19.3\
However, you reminded us that no victory in fantasy football is in the bag after starting strong\
So for that, we thank you


#### Good Luck in Week 3 you fucking degenerates.
