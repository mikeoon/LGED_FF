# LGED 21-22 Week-2 Recap: A New League Record Low and a Bench

### Whaddup

Week 2 we saw a record breaking performance and some drama that comes in the form of a bench. Remember boys, it's early. Make some waiver moves or better yet send out some trade requests.

Onto week 2

| ------------------------ |:-------------:| --------------------|:----------:|
|     **I need Moore points**      |**122.7**     | Connor Cooks KuppCakes|   109.58  |

The points keep coming for Junghwan. He rates Connor’s Kuppcakes 1 and out of 5 stars on Yelp and gets the W. Is it the year of the Dolphin?? Jaylen Waddle more than doubles his fantasy output from last week. Waddle caught 11 passes for 171 yards and 2 TDs. Junghwan also has the leader of the pod, Tua Tagovailoa, on the bench. Saquon Barkley and Michael Thomas continue their comeback tour both with 10+ points. Austin Ekeler doesn’t find the endzone for the second straight week but puts together a 13.9 fantasy points. Cause for concern? Naaah it’s too early. Patrick Mahomes cooled off a bit and scored half the points he had in week 1. A lot of good production early for Junghwan’s team, got to be happy starting 2 - 0. Connor hasn’t quite figured out his recipe yet for this season, but he has plenty of time. His RB’s have been a little underwhelming. James Conner needs some more time in the oven and Ezekiel Elliot may have gone bad already. Cooper Kupp, the showstopper for the team, continues to do what he does best. Kupp is going for the triple crown again. Kupp already has 24 receptions, 236 receiving yards and 3 TDs. He does not lead all WR in fantasy though (WR 2 overall)… that’s another guy with two repeated consonants at the end of his last name. Connor’s “supporting” cast did well this week. His TE, FLEX, D/ST and K all scored 10+ points. Matt Stafford already has 5 INTs on the season, but he threw for 2 TDs.The Connor’s recipe is still being tweaked for that 5 star rating.

|     **Poop AUTO**      |**158.62**     | Koo Kicks Clan|   130.82  |

The points were flying in this matchup. Kai and the bunch nab the W over Eugene in a match where we saw the highest scoring team vs the third highest. More on Kai’s big time performance below. Tough loss for Eugene. Things didn’t look good following Thursday Night Football after Marquez Valdes-Scantling put up only 2.3 fantasy points. Then… Came… LAMAAARRR JACKSSSSOOOONNNN. Vintage(?) Lamar. The former unanimous MVP threw for 318 yards and 3 TDs on 72.4% completion. He ran for 119 yards and a TD. Lamar went big… but the Ravens still lost just like Eugene’s team. Diontae Johnson and Dallas Goedert both put up 10.7 fantasy points. D’Andre Swift this week scores a TD through the air. Davante Adams caught just 2 passes. One of them was a TD which salvaged an otherwise bad follow up performance for Adams’ Raider debut. The Bills D/St did their best to keep Eugene in the matchup on Monday Night Football, but they fell a bit short. No worries for Eugene as this is his second week in a row scoring 130+ points.

|     **OJ is my GM**      |**81.96**     | Carroll’s A Coward|   38.76  |

My oh my. We have a new record low. Not just this season but across all 5 seasons thus far. Kyle has the record for LGED lowest scoring week. He beat out his own previous record, set last season, 40.3 points. More on Kyle’s record breaking performances below. This was a layup for Anil and OJ. Credit where credit is due though as Anil gets his first win of the season. James Robinson rushes for a TD for the second week in a row. Robinson gets the bulk of the carries for the Jags and looks promising in the early going. Miles Sanders also got his reps and is looking good early. Josh Jacobs is under performing a bit but the Raiders are getting used to a new coach and some new faces on offense. Aaron Rogers improves but still seems like he doesn’t trust his young WR core. Look at that, now I’m putting the blame on the WRs in Green Bay. Alvin Kamara was scratched due to a rib injury and George Kittle has yet to suit up. Anil and OJ always have something up their sleeves, excited to see what that might be heading into week 3.

|     **Kingdom DooDoo**      |**139.6**     | DK’s Left Calf|   86.36  |

This episode of Kingdom DooDoo was much better. Miles hands Zach his first loss thanks to Miles’ team scoring the second highest this week. Derrick Henry currently sits on the iron throne in Kingdom DooDoo. Tyreek Hill looks to take the throne with his latest performance. Hill puts up Kansas City numbers with 11 catches for 190 yards and 2 TDs. Hill was targeted 13 times. King Henry finds the endzone this week. However, he couldn’t get going on the ground in Buffalo. Amari Cooper has his best game as a Brown so far with 9 catches for 101 yards and a TD. Rashaad Penny was sparingly used as the Seahawks shared some of the backfield reps with Kenneth Walker III (go hawks). The loyal Hound, Evan McPherson, scores 13 fantasy points. McPherson is gonna have to keep that up to keep his value with the 91st pick in the fantasy draft. The Hound usually gets it done… unless he’s afraid to catch fire. Big week for MIles. Always good to see your top picked player getting carried now and then by the rest of the team. Zach’s team didn’t have the same success it did last week. Some flip flopping of performances with players that boomed in week 1 fell a bit flat in week 2 and vice versa. Five of Zach’s players scored less than half the points they did in week 1. Aaron Jones on the other hand, had one of his patented 30+ point explosions where the Packers offense only decides to score through Jones. Clyde Edwards-Helaire is showing good production with 118 yards from scrimmage. DK Metcalf is feeling the offensive woes in Seattle (go hawks). With Keenan Allen out, Zach will have to rally his troops a bit. Players like Rashod Bateman are showing great value and may make Zach forget about Allen being out. With some favorable matchups for Zach’s players next week, I expect Zach to bounce back in scoring.

|     **Yoon Pooned**      |**124.48**     | Straight Outta Hopkins|   124.28  |

This has to be one of the most drama filled matchups we have had in the history of the league. With overtime thrillers, players getting benched and even a regretted touchdown, this matchup had it all. My team, by the slimmest of margins, steals the win from Matt. This week, my team finished early. All my players had played after the afternoon slew of games. Christian Kirk is starting to show the league why he was offered a fat contract with 6 catches for 78 yards and 2 TDs. Christian McCaffrey has over 100 yards from scrimmage. A steady start for CMC… which I hope means they are being cautious. Then comes the antics. Kyler Murray wills his team to victory with his late heroics. Murray scored and converted a 2 point conversion to [send it to OT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF9fmUQVQPM). Other late game heroics include Nick Chubb scoring under 2 minutes against the Jets. Chubb later [regretted the TD](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34631088/cleveland-browns-rb-nick-chubb-admits-scoring-late-td-vs-new-york-jets-cost-us-game) which made the finale of my matchup with Matt all that more hilarious. My team ended Sunday afternoon with a 29.88 point lead. Matt had only one player left, Josh Allen on Monday Night Football. Allen scorched the Titans scoring easily in the air and on the ground. A pick 6 from the Buffalo D/ST put the Bills up by 34 points. Then… both teams decided it was over. The Bills bench Josh Allen. He finished with 29.68 points. Matt was just 0.2 points away from victory. I couldn’t believe it, no one did. Despite the horrible luck, Matt’s team did well in week 2. Drake London scored his first TD in the NFL and put up 20.6 fantasy points. Curtis Samuel is enjoying Carson Wentz’s resurgence with Samuel scoring another TD. Fantasy football is hilariously brutal. More fun to come with Matt facing Eugene in week 3.

|     **I Should Have Autodrafted**      |**106.78**     | Lance Refrigeration|   77.0  |

Danny shrugs off his week 1 lowest scoring performances with a W this week against Andrew’s small business. Danny immediately picks up Darrell Henderson Jr. and starts him over Cam Akers. Henderson Jr. outscored Akers by 3.5 points. Mike Williams must have heard or smelled the roast last week and scored more than 10 times the points he did last week. Carson Wentz is showing us why he still belongs as a starting QB in the NFL with back to back 27 point performances. Still some INTs for Wentz, but he’s producing. Quieter week for Kelce, but still remains the top TE in this early season. The Steelers continue to try and figure out their offense. Najee Harris is feeling it a bit, but is producing on the ground and in the air. I expect Danny to continue to be active in the waiver wire as he always is. Andrew continues to receive low ratings from customers. We saw Trey Lance go down with a nasty ankle injury as he got rolled up on and is out for the season. Andrew’s Buccaneers duo didn’t perform as well in week 2. Mike Evans [fights Marshon Lattimore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6_g5EQdN5k) and gets ejected in the 4th quarter. Leonard Fournette rushed for only 65 yards but at least [he apologized](https://twitter.com/_fournette/status/1571886418284220416?s=20&t=yDXqG33DQVkkY-jWvH1-Uw). Kyle Pitts for the second week in a row records 2 catches for 19 yards, 2.9 fantasy points.  Dalvin Cook only carried the ball 6 times... The vikings may be confusing load management with time off. It seems like a lot of Andrew’s team is being underused. Amon-Ra St.Brown is looking like a tasty trade piece. St.Brown catches one more ball than last week but finishes the game with 52 more yards and another TD (32.9 fantasy points). Some nice production on Andrew’s bench. Courtland Sutton and Garrett Wilson combine for 42.2 points. With a new business comes some upfront costs you just have to eat. For Andrew, that’s starting the season 0 - 2. Next up, Yoon Pooned.

## Lowest Scoring Team
**Carroll’s A Coward**\
**38.76 Points**\
**Best Player: Breece Hall RB - 12.5 Points**\
I’m amazed\
I’m crying\
I’m impressed\
The lack of quality in the team you put out this week is astonishing\
Stefon Diggs alone out scored your entire starting lineup (38.8 vs 38.76)\
Your bench outscored your starts with just 5 players, 51.1 points\
The Dolphins D/ST decreased in points by 142%\
As much as I love to see Russell Wilson do poorly with the Broncos, I’m shocked at how his poor game is providing the second highest point total for your team with 11.06 points\
Wilson outscored 6 other players on your team combined (11.06 vs 6.9)\
I honestly can’t tell if this was done on purpose or just extremely bad luck\
However, you remind us that drafting can be important even if it’s not why you win the league\
So for that, we thank you

#### Good luck in week 3 you fucking degenerates
