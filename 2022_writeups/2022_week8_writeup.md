# LGED 21-22 Week-8 Recap: We're Back Like Nothing Happened

### Whaddup

Hoo Hoooooo it’s been a while hasn’t it?

Things have gotten interesting in the league. Two teams have separated themselves in their respective divisions. While one team hasn’t recorded a win since week 1.

Please everyone calm down. I know y’all have been itching for a writeup

Let’s get to it

|     **I need Moore Points**      |**128.66**     | Straight Outta Hopkins|   100.82  |

The heavy weight matchup. The top 2 teams in each division went head to head. These teams combined for just 2 losses on the season. In the end, it was Junghwan who out dueled Matt. Jaylen Waddle continues to be a top 5 WR with 8 receptions for 106 yards and 2 TDs. Boy did the Dolphins miss Tua. Who let Junghwan even pick up D’Onta Foreman? Since Christian McCaffrey’s departure, Foreman has recorded back to back weeks with 118 rushing yards. This week? Foreman punches in 3 TDs. How bout dem Cowboys defense? This is the 5 week the Cowboys D/ST has scored over 10 points. They are currently allowing 16 points a game (17 if you round up). Scary part? Patrick Mahomes and Austin Ekeler were both on byes. Junghwan’s only loss came at the hands of Zach in week 4. We’ll see how many Moore points Junghwan and crew will score. A valiant effort from Matt and team. This week, no outage of DeAndre Hopkins. Nuke seems to be back with 12 catches for 159 yards and a TD. I’m sure Matt and Cardinal’s fans are ecstatic. Josh Allen coming off a bye week has his worst performance of the season so far. Allen threw 2 interceptions. Probably just rust after a restful week. I don’t think Matt’s team has reached it’s full potential with Jonathan Taylor, outside of week 1, being a shell of his former self. Mark Andrews also seems to be in a rut with only 5.2 fantasy points combined the last two weeks. Regardless, Matt only has 2 losses and still remains top of the East Division. Next up, a hungry Anil and OJ.

|     **Kingdom DooDoo**      |**131.44**     | I Should Have Autodrafted|   109.6  |

Miles defends his throne as he fends off Danny for his 5th win of the season. Derrick Henry still reigns supreme in Kingdom DooDoo. Two weeks in a row King Henry has 30 or or more carries. This week, he breaks over 200 yards since week 17 of the 2020 season. Tyreek Hill is making his own case to rule with his 4th game with over 150 receiving yards and 10+ receptions. Hill sits as WR2 on the season so far with only 2 TDs scored, that’s pretty wild. Joining in on best performances is Justin Fields. Fields has been doing it all as of late with rushing and passing TDs. This was only Fields’ third game without an interception. Miles and team look to continue the good times against Eugene in week 9. Danny managed to halt a three game skid in week 7 only to fall to lose this week. Tony Pollard did his best to carry the team with 3 rushing TDs on 131 carries (Ezekiel who?). Outside of that not enough production from the team. Travis Kelce and Mike Williams both were on bye and are both highly targeted in their respective offenses. Najee Harris is definitely in a sophomore slump. Last season, through the first 8 games Harris had 541 yards and 4 TDs. This year, 361 yards and 1 TD. Daniel Jones follows up his best fantasy performance of the season with his worst against the Seahawks (go hawks). Danny’s next opponent, the hottest team in the league, I need Moore Points.

|     **Lance Refrigeration**      |**104.62**     | Carroll’s A Coward|   85.24  |

Solid win for Andrew as he takes down Kyle. Solid because Kyle is the lowest scoring team this week. More on Kyle’s repeated performance below. No help for Andrew coming from UK version of Trevor Lawrence. On the other hand, Kyle Pitts has his best game of the season. You win some you lose some. Dalvin Cook comes off the bye week and whips up 111 rushing yards and a TD. Cook also topped his dish with 30 receiving yards. Outside of Cook, good performances all around with no other high scoring players. Regardless, Andrew and squad got the job done. Also Kenneth Walker III’s nickname K9, is probably one of the best I’ve heard in a while, change my mind.

|     **Poop AUTO**      |**161.4**     | Sorry KuppCake Crew|   93.4  |

Who woke up Kai for his morning shit?? Kai sets the new record for highest scoring team this season demolishing Connor’s team in the process. More on Kai’s dank performance below. Nothing much Connor could do this week going against 161.4 points. Connor’s cupcakes lack a bit of RBs in their flavor. James Connor has been hurt, Ezekiel Elliot continues to be shell of the RB he used to be and let’s face it, Brian Robinson Jr. and Latavius Murray aren’t the guys. Connor isn’t new to this type of situation as we saw last season. Quality play across his other positions have gotten him to a 3 – 5 record thus far and in the playoff hunt still as just under half the league also sits at 3 – 5. I think Connor is just happy that Cooper Kupp escaped a major ankle injury. Kupp has never dipped below 13 points this season. There is a reason why he is the signature cupcake flavor. The KuppCake crew will continue to experiment with new flavors, it’s the recipe for success the reigning champ used last year.

|     **Yoon Pooned**      |**135.44**     | OJ is my GM|   97.82  |

Both teams were looking to reach .500 in this matchup. My team came out on top against Anil and OJ. I was a little worried when the prodigal son Cristian McCaffrey returned to the bay area and put up only 7.2 points. CMC made up for this week by posting 3 TDs 3 different ways. CMC also put up a total of 149 yards from scrimmage. Rhamondre Stevenson continuing to produce for the Patriots. Stevenson hasn’t dipped below 10 points since week 2. Nick Chubb continued the RB scoring party for my team on MNF. Chubb scored 2 TDs with 101 rushing yards. Here’s to me hoping my RBs can keep this team winning. It’s either that or… let’s ride? Anil must have been busy with Halloween festivities as Deebo Samuel remained in his starting lineup after he was announced out on Friday. Alvin Kamara did his best to will Anil’s team to victory with 162 yards from scrimmage on 9 receptions and 2 receiving TDs (38.3 points). George Kittle seems to have found his groove with back to back weeks with a TD. This is also Kittle’s Third week in a row with 12+ points. Next week though? Bye week. DJ Moore could have provided some additional help but was left on the bench. Maybe OJ knew Moore would take his helmet off after he caught a Hail Mary pass. Either way, Moore was may have been the reason for both losses.

|     **DK’s Left Calf**      |**97.78**     | @me for Free Wins|   93.6  |

Zach pretty much buried Eugene’s chances of making the playoff this week by handing Eugene his seventh loss of the season. Back to back losses for Zach since sitting at 4 – 1. Zach hasn’t broken over 100 points since week 4, but that doesn’t stop the wins from coming. Aaron Jones has his third 100+ yard rushing game this season. Jones has been solid despite only rushing for 1 TD so far this season. He has 3 receiving TDs. Speak of TD woes, Just Jefferson only has 2 receiving TDs on the season and hasn’t caught a TD pass since week 1. To top it off, DK Metcalf just hauled in his 3rd TD of the season. All this to say, Zach’s team is winning despite the lack of TDs. Something that him and his team deserve credit for. Something tells me, Zach’s team is all backloaded with touch downs. I’d be surprised if this kept up. Tough loss for Eugene. He hasn’t won since week 1, which was also his best scoring week this season. A mix of injuries to key players and streaky performances from others have left Eugene with the record he has today. Eugene’s top 2 players have been Lamar Jackson and Davante Adams. Both of whom are inconsistent. Sprinkle in an injury to D’Andre Swift who only has recently come back. And David Montgomery who hasn’t made a real impact on fantasy or the Bears. All that could be going wrong for Eugene really has at this point. Still, week to week, I would not sleep on Eugene’s team. Despite the streakiness, most of Eugene’s players have the ability to just wreak havoc. Eugene’s here to ruin everyone else’s season now. 


## Highest Scoring Team
**Poop AUTO - Kai**\
**161.4 Points**\
**Best Player: A.J. Brown WR - 36.6 Points**\
Thank god Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown were benched before the 4th quarter\
Brown scored more this week than he had his last 3 week’s combined (not including week 7 bye)\
Is Hurts the dark horse this year for MVP? Yes\
Is Travis Etienne Jr. making his case for Offensive Rookie of the Year? Yes\
Is Zach Ertz making teams and people regret calling him washed? Yes\
Top it all off with Stefon Diggs breaking 100+ reciveing yards in all but 2 games this season\
After a 5 game losing streak, this may be the turning point for Kai and Crew, glad I don’t have to play him anymore in the regular season\



## Lowest Scoring Team
**Carroll’s A Coward - Kyle**\
**85.24 Points**\
**Best Player: Kyler Murray QB - 24.64 Points**\
Welcome back for the third time\
You’ve come so far only to be brought back into the roast\
You’re RB choices are brutal, I wouldn’t have trusted Khalil Herbert or Chase Edmonds either\
Tee Higgins is not Ja’Marr Chase\
Drake London hasn’t done anything since week 3, he’s averaging 4.04 fantasy points a game since\
I know. I get it. How can you even fathom starting a guy named Devin Duvernay\
Your kicker Greg Joseph has only hit 1 FG in his last three games, he’s missed 3 FG and 1 XP in that time\
Your team did so bad this week, 2 of your players were traded away to other teams\
However, you remind us that fantasy can be about putting the best possible team you can with what’s left out there on the waivers\
So for that, we thank you\



#### Good luck in week 9 you fucking degenerates
